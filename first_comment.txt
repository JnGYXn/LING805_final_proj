I wish I had found this out sooner, or my account wouldn’t be banned right now. I was messaging someone “Everyone in the US thinks that communism is evil but everyone on this app is very kind.” I think my mention of communism made my account get banned. I can still use it, but interacting with anyone in any way is prohibited for me. Sigh.
