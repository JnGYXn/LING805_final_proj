5,Same. I’ve had a few people ask me about the ban and I just told them unfortunately OUR Government is out of touch and thinks China is out to get us. When all they want is cat videos. That seems to be a winner for the answer. Most of them like that one. My cats are getting so famous on there. Within an hr they had over 1k likes.,69
6,This also could be just bad luck. There's a possibility that the algorithm thought you were a bot based on your IP adress. It's quite rare for the server to have this amount of foreign IPs accessing and signing up from foreign countries suddenly in one day. Normally it should be spam-bots attacking but not today though.,57

3,"Israel is pretty popular in China because of the economic ties and the fact that China also suffered from Islamic terrorist attacks.

3,"In China, religious topics can be discussed, but the following points should be noted:

**Legal framework**: China's Constitution guarantees freedom of religious belief, but religious activities must be carried out within the law and must not violate social order or harm the rights and interests of others.

**Religious policy**: The government manages religious affairs according to law, adheres to the principle of separating religion from politics and education, and prevents religious interference in administration, justice and education.

**Social harmony**: Religion should be discussed with respect for different beliefs to avoid sparking conflict or undermining national unity.

**Cultural background**: China is a multi-religious country, with Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Christianity, etc., and the history and culture of each religion should be respected during discussion.

**Online speech**: When discussing religion on the Internet, it is necessary to abide by relevant laws and regulations to avoid spreading extreme or illegal content.

All in all, religion should be discussed with respect for the law, culture and social harmony to avoid controversy.

This is the answer provided by the AI, and I think it is generally accurate. Additionally, I would like to mention that the majority of Chinese people are atheists, although some still worship ancestors or deities, including myself. Perhaps this behavior can be summarized as a traditional custom.

**Note**: My English is not good, use the translation, hope to help you group",228
2,"If you want to gain more attention, you can share content related to daily life (such as cooking, life hacks), pets (for example, someone mentioned that posting about cats gets a lot of likes and comments), or talents (like singing, dancing), as these topics tend to interest people more.",49

Lies, hatreds and rumors spread by big companies. It's just you have to find a way to stop them destroying everything you can believe.

I admit there are censorship from our gov now, but hell it's still way better that the only rule is to be ""polite or get banned"" than ""you have to support certain ideology that pops up in a daily basis otherwise your identity will get blown on internet and lose your job immediately"".

Also, there are places that you needn't to be polite like Tieba (something like Chinese version of Reddit). There you can swear people, the gov, the everything in the world as long as the mods leaves you be. It's just Rednote is a place for people who looks for relaxation and peace in mind.

8,"Honestly, I don't think these points as ""self-censoring"", but more like ""how to speak rationally"".

I don't see the point why ""don't talk politics aggresively"" or ""don't support drugs"" are some kind of self-censoring hell.

Secondly, I've been using English and Japanese social medias for like almost ten yesrs since I speak both languages, and I feel every country has some sort of censoring. People get banned in America in a light speed for supporting Palestine and Russia, and they even would lose their jobs for that. But you don't get banned in China no matter you're supporting Israel or Palestine or Ukraine or Russia, literally. Sometimes I really don't know which side has the so-called ""freedom of speech"" honestly.",120
7,"What's funny is that you never saw the full video and never know how the incident begins at all, yet you still act like it happens right before your face from some bs liberty media.

Innocent people were robbed raped killed in that riot by those ""libertarians"", and they somehow turned into heros?

Then who would speak for those poor souls who just wanna live their life with their kids? Who would protect their familily and children that were left alone? Who would put those murderers and killers that participated into jail?

It's just because these websites don't want to go into trouble caused by vague regulations issued by government, so they stricken the censorship themselves to prevent that. In another word, the government sometimes could tolerate few things but sometimes not, so the media platform just ban everything __they think__ that could disturb the government while actually gov don't give a cr@p about.",93

4,"Firstly, the most important aspect is Xiaohongshu's review mechanism. On Xiaohongshu, topics such as gambling, pornography, drugs, and homosexuality are restricted. If these topics are discussed, the account’s posting and commenting features may be limited, and in severe cases, the account could be banned.

Additionally, Xiaohongshu has many restrictions regarding advertising. These are referred to as ""sensitive behaviors."" If content involves things like the claims of health products, directly guiding the purchase of a particular product, or directly recommending a product, and these actions have not been officially reported or paid for, they will be restricted. In severe cases, the account may be banned.

Xiaohongshu provides an official platform for business engagement. Merchants can apply for an official brand account or cooperate through official channels to invite Xiaohongshu influencers to promote their products.

Additionally, Xiaohongshu originally started as a shopping recommendation platform. The users on Xiaohongshu are more focused on life itself. They trust the platform greatly and tend to search for answers to almost any question there.

This is a very interesting post and I like the points you pose. I can share experience and thoughts on a few of these from the mostly typical American perspectives.  Mileage may vary.

Metropolitan areas like Portland and Salt Lake City tend to have more college-educated individuals due to diverse professors and coursework. Higher education broadens perspectives, while rural areas often prioritize trades, agriculture, and family life.




In places like Ohio, the lower cost of living and fewer high-paying job opportunities reduce the emphasis on higher education. Life revolves around tight-knit communities—family, friends, and neighbors—rather than meeting people from across the world. The focus is on maintaining strong local connections, not expanding global perspectives.




Reddit has its fair share of contrarians who love to argue but hate being challenged, creating endless echo chambers. Political divides have made this worse, and while Facebook has similar issues, 4chan is the bottom of the barrel, fostering extremists and incels who blame women for their loneliness. That said, Reddit isn’t all bad. There are still great subs like RedNote, animal rights activism, photography circles, and small animal care communities that make it worth staying.




Extreme wealth is shoved in our faces daily, while the lower middle class is ignored. Wealth equals morality, which is completely backward. One of the worst offenders? “Tradwife” influencers—privileged housewives in designer clothes, whipping up homemade gummy bears in spotless kitchens (definitely maintained by a maid) while preaching submission to husbands. These women ooze privilege, dragging their unschooled kids on voluntourism trips just to exploit village children for Instagram Likes. It’s as fake as those staged animal rescue videos where they “save” the creature they just put in danger.




As a stay-at-home mom, my reality is vastly different. Most of us don’t have the financial luxury to stay home, and for autistic parents with autistic kids like me, keeping a job is even harder. That means getting creative with expenses. At least Reddit has decent moderators who delete the worst content, and I’m grateful for platforms where activism can still be shared—especially since access to real resistance news is becoming harder to find.",353

1,"Thank you for sharing your perspective on rednote aka xiaohongshu. Based on my observations over the past while, i’ve found that rednote is generally a calm, positive, and supportive social platform. of course, like any social platform, there are also unfriendly or ""bad” people, but that’s something you’ll find on every social media platform.

From what I’ve seen, rednote user base seems incredibly diverse. It has white-collar professionals and wealthy individuals from magecities like shanghai/beijing/shezhen, working-class folks and everyday people from smaller 2 or 3 tier citys, and farmers and herders from rural areas, as well as a ton of artists, craftsmen, and many china minority content creators. This diversity has been really surprising to me. After tiktok ban, there're also a lot of users from the US, Europe, and Africa, which makes it like a global village.

I’ve also noticed that many rednoters mention the search function in there. many brag it is excellent—in some ways, after i tried, i feel it even better than google or bing, especially for solving everyday life problems or giving travel tips. AIA rednote is full of practical, experience-based answers that feel very human and relatable. Speaking of Google, I’d like to clarify that google isn’t blocked/banned in china. From what I understand, google chose not to store its data in China, which is required by Chinese law, so its services aren’t available there. However, google’s commercial advertise services are remained and very profitable in China. so, it’s not accurate to say that “google is blocked or banned by china.” as far as i know, bill gate’s Bing and apple iCloud operate just fine in china.

As for how rednote users view other social platforms, I cannot speak for them but from what i observed, i'd say they’re pretty neutral overall, actually you can find lot of  posts discussing these topics; as long as it serves a specific need or purpose, chinese users will use it. reddit, for instance, doesn’t have many users in China, which might be good since reddit’s content, especially when it comes to chinese people and politics, often carries the typical Western biases and political correctness. but honestly, that’s not a huge deal—who can claim to be completely fair and impartial? Time will tell the full story.

At the end of the day, rednote can be seen as a small window into knowing china and its culture etc, as well as a place to discover interesting contents from all over the world. From that perspective, rednote is a great choice.",421
12,r/china is one of the worst non-4chan places on the internet,11
2,"Interesting! I did see several posts of people showing their homes (apartments, I suppose). They would all throw around huge numbers, but a similarly priced home where I live won't get you much (I live on Canada's West Coast), and yes, I converted from Yuan to CAD.

I enjoy cooking, and there are a few people I follow to learn how to cook Asian dishes (though my partner and ex are both Korean).

Mostly I'd like to better understand Chinese lifestyle from someone living there as such there are several (what seems to me as down to Earth) Chinese and non-Chinese who are American or other nationalities I like to follow.

I guess the Western media has ingrained how bad China is, so we all go in with preconceived notions and are always skeptical. But so far, everything feels authentic, but you take it all with a grain of sand.

Several mentions of toxicity - I guess I haven't found those yet - but if ""flexing"" is considered toxic, then yeah, I've seen quite a bit of that. But other than that, I haven't run into anything truly toxic.

And like TT, a lot of thirsttraps and some incredibly attractive people.

I love hearing what Chinese people think of the RedNote platform, though, and sharing their views. It does help balance things out.

So far, I really enjoy doom scrolling.",230
5,You won’t get any useful info just by going to major cities since China has an extreme urban/rural divide in terms of wealth and quality of life. But if you can’t speak Chinese it’s very difficult to navigate the more remote parts to say the least.,46
0,"I can’t believe how many Americans assume that what they read in newspapers about China is propaganda, yet they’ll go onto a heavily censored Chinese social media platform to “learn the truth.” The stuff reported in your newspapers is basically the tamest version of all the bad things happening in China. Foreign media has extremely limited freedom to conduct interviews or investigations here, so they have no other way to uncover reality especially when the CCP is so effective at controlling the flow of information. Those of us actually living in China see and experience the most messed-up realities every day. Many Americans are blinded by their dislike of their own government and then make so many ridiculous conclusions. If you really want a deeper understanding, you’d learn far more by talking to a few middle-aged Chinese immigrants than you would from spending ten months on Xiaohongshu. Enjoy Xionghongshu as much as you want but don’t consider it as the “truth”",161
6,"Yes, Douyin is quite literally the Chinese version of TikTok (both owned by BydeDance), whereas “RedNote is the Chinese version of IG” is more on the metaphorical level",28
6,"Tier-1 cities: Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen

Tier-2 cities: Chengdu, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Tianjin, Wuhan, etc. (\~15 cities in total)

Basically tier-1 cities have a strong international element (more foreign companies, more foreigners living there), have better education and public health, and the cost of living there is much worse. In the U.S. tier-1 cities would be NYC, LA, Chicago, San Francisco and DC; and “strong tier-2” cities would be Boston, Seattle, Philly, Houston, Dallas and Miami.

RedNote users are mostly young white-collar workers in tier-1 and tier-2 cities, and ~~screw~~ skew female. This means that their purchasing power (real or fake) is much higher than other Chinese people, their social views are generally more liberal/progressive, and their lifestyle is generally more bourgeois. So most rural people, and even people in small cities, as well as the elders, are marginalized there (which tbf is the case for Chinese social media, or perhaps social media anywhere, in general) — although you can see some posts on RedNote about rural life if you intentionally search for such contents. And as I wrote in point (1) in the main thread, RedNote just has a much more pretentious vibe.",194
1,Rednote has 300+ million users. The population of China 18-64 is ~800 million. If you know elementary statistics then sampling 1/2 of a large sample in the absence of a filtering mechanism like a paywall means you have a statistically representative sample.,42
1,"I wouldn’t specifically break it up by cities. It’s a lifestyle app akin to Pinterest and IG. You can definitely find popular people posting from all over China. There’s no shortage of rural creators who don’t come from wealth too. But the common denominator is that romanticizing life is going to get the most engagement. People browse red note for aspirational content and escapism. So if it’s content from the countryside, expect Liziqi style rural beauty, natural landscapes, and crafting videos",81
2,"I think part of this is the app was downloaded and used so heavily by Americans who were so addicted to TikTok that they downloaded the first thing they were told was similar. These are not the most intellectually curious people - these are people who spend hours every day staring at a screen and moving a thumb. 

Also, these people seemed to be amazed at photos of buildings in China. These people could have googled this stuff at any point they wanted. They could have downloaded RedNote before TikTok shut down. They could have gone to their local library and checked out a book written by a Chinese author. They could have done *anything* if they were curious enough. They didn't want to. 

The 'Chinese people are so nice' thing. Have these people never met a person from China? Why are they so surprised? I went to university with scores of people from China. I had professors from China. I've worked with people from China. How is this their first time interacting with a person from China? That always made me quite sad for those people. I imagine they spend most of their time indoors looking at their phone. Why is this their first exposure to Chinese culture? It's bizarre to me. 

And don't even get me started with how the Americans on the app can't understand the difference between the words 'income' and 'net worth', lol. That actually says a lot about the type of people who use the app. 

Oh, and the people who say, 'my government told me that xxx is in China, but now I see it's not true on RedNote'. First - I don't think these people listen to anything but social media in the first place, so whatever perceptions they have of *anything* is probably shaped solely by social media. When I asked them for sources about how their government told them about China, they point me to Chinese state-run media, quotes from Chinese officials, or they can't remember where they heard it. 

I actually feel bad for the Chinese people who are now interacting with these people. It might be entertaining at first, but I think I'd do anything I could to get away from them after a while.",377
7,"momo, absolutely",2
6,"Yes and the mods will like strike down any China truths that dare leak out there, it's bizarre. but every day somewhere on reddit it's ""how can we rescue the chinese children from the brutal education sector"" like um is this because they're all demolishing you at school stuffs??",49
3,"If you've only seen people sharing how their very regular home/apartments look like and not like.... showing off how many luxury branded stuff they owned then I think your algorithm's just pushing middle-class lifestyle kind of content and not those of the super rich. And that's better actually. More relatable. At least to me, that is.

I mean, I've seen videos of the rich making a trip to Chanel and buying like 10k USD stuff at one go and be like, ""Oh this is nothing. I've spent so much and so much at \[Luxury Brand Store This and That\] before."".... I mean, I CAN NOT RELATE AT ALL. 

Also when I say toxic, I mean like.... sometimes when people perceived you said something wrong or they just didn't like your comment/opinion on Xiaohongshu, they dog pile you. Just like Reddit. 

My first week on Reddit, 2 different people made fun of me when I used ""oh"" in a sentence as a filler word because I didn't know what else to say. A couple more got really sarcastic and nasty when I asked about some English slang someone else commented because English is my 3rd language and I don't always get certain internet speak in English. I had to delete my comment because.... yeah, they were really getting to me.  

That said, you can curate what you see on Xiaohongshu a lot easier than other English platforms so not only is it possible to stay away from the toxic and just engage with the positive ones, it's also possible to make sure that it stays that way long term. 

I'm honestly so glad that... well, now people know the truth about China and Chinese lifestyle in general :) 

Have fun doom scrolling! We do that too :)",296
0,Like American propaganda?,3
3,"Thank you! Very good explanation and comparison to US cities. So, I do think that you might have meant in the first sentence of the last paragraph that tier-1and  tier-2 cities skew female...not screw. Although that does add an interesting perspective 😉 

I spend a lot of time in Mexico and am always interested in the culture and customs of other countries.

Again, thank you.",65
3,"Interesting analysis. As a side question, for someone interested on travelling to China, is there any meaningful difference between tier 1 and tier 2 cities, outside of perhaps cost and amount of interantional elements? 

Also, you can probably tell that in the US, many rural areas and small towns are in pretty rough shape and getting worse overall. How would you characterize the situation in such rural/small town China in general?",71
1,"I don't think the US city tiers compare to the China city tiers, because we have different issues with poverty and drugs that aren't quite the same in China. 

Boston is also world renowned for both first class medical care and education. I would put Boston as ""tier 1"" before LA/SF (which are known more for their homeless and drug addiction issues).",62
1,wrong...your tier 2 are new Tier 1 cities...there are also 30 tier 3 cities.  I see ppl from the top 50 or so cities in china.  not just the top 20,31
1," Thank you! So, another question, if I may, and if you know: First a comparison - older Americans (60+) seem to use mainly FB, and some TT. Do older Chinese use social media platforms and if so, for what purpose? Seems like a silly question but Chinese seem (at least to me) to be more tech minded. I'm hoping that is true across the generations.",65
1,Thank you! I don't use IG or Pinterest so I don't really have a reference point. I only downloaded TT two days before it 'took a day off' just to see what all the fuss was about. I also don't use FB except for very specific things I can't get anywhere else. All that non-relevant stuff being said...am enjoying red note a lot. Trying to expand my algorithm so I see more/different things. Thank you again.,76
1,The reality of China is much worse than what you read and thought was “American propaganda”. I’m Chinese and I lived in China in almost 30 years. I go back to China every year to visit my parents.,38
2,"Yes, it should be ""skew"" rather than ""screw"" lol. Thanks for pointing out",13
4,"1. Every city has its own culture and specialty.
2. There is a big gap between rural countryside and urban city, especially in north and west provinces. But our situation is rural places are getting better not worse. Goverment has plan to improve the level of infrastrues and life quality.",50
3,"My perspective as an ABC who visited family in a bunch of parts of China recently!

\-There will be way more foreigners working and visiting in Tier 1 cities, but lots of Tier 2 cities also have many other foreigners at this point. The foreigners in Tier 2 cities (from my experience) will be fewer and generally English proficiency among locals will be somewhat worse though so plan accordingly with a translate app or something

\-If you're from the US, Tier 1 cities might feel more ""familiar"" with more chains, businesses you know, and attractions like Disneyland since lots of Chinese people themselves might travel to Tier 1 cities for an international experience

\-Rural parts lag behind in development but they're trying to improve! I'd really recommend you check out some rural parts because it's just so different and charming, like off the beaten path with locals who seem way friendlier and relaxed than the busy environment of the city. Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities just feel impersonal in my opinion, where everyone just rushes by. The rural towns don't feel like that and it's refreshing

\-Trying the food in rural areas is such a great experience. Lots of it is very directly farm-to-table stuff and it's handmade by traditional means so you aren't looking at some mass produced standardized recipe that's been served hundreds of times. Like most rural homestyle cooking, every dish is gonna be a bit different too so you're going to get something unique!

\-If visiting rural areas, just be mindful that they can be car dependent and public transit isn't going to be as developed so you might have to rely on a car or a taxi often

\-Rural towns like the one where my family originates have practically no English at all and usually no one is conversational in English",307
1,"Tier-1 cities are much bigger, although even tier-2 cities are huge by American standard. Tier-1 cities have more ""conventional"" tourist attractions (think of Los Angeles vs Phoenix), and are generally more ""beginner-friendly"" regarding e.g., payment, hotels, and the language (more people in tier-1 cities speak reasonable English). If you have never been to China and your first experience is a tier-2 city, there might be some difficulties.

I'd say rural areas and small towns in China are also in decline, but the reason might be slightly different than the similar phenomenon in the U.S. The main reason is that most young people there have moved to bigger cities for better job opportunities, leaving the towns/villages half-empty with mostly elder people; in particular, there are fewer people actively farming the land. (I know this is also the case for some places in the U.S., but it happens much faster and on a much larger scale in China.) Another reason — which might be closer to why the Rust Belt is in decline in the U.S. — is that some towns boomed due to natural resources, and once the natural resources are exhausted or used less (due to e.g., switching to clean energy), the local economy just collapses. One extreme example is Old Town Yumen (玉门老城), which used to be an oil town but has been nearly completely abandoned after the government moved to the new downtown; you can see some [eerie videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe0ST-qNP64) online.",242

2,"Thank you! I’m really enjoying the experience so far. It has been entertaining watching some tiktokers come through, but everything else I’ve seen about this app has been so warm and welcoming and it’s honestly made me tear up once or twice. 

It’s been amazing watching people kind of just jokingly take North Americans in with their little jokes, like a cool cousin welcoming you to their place for the first time. People have been posting videos about different Chinese towns, and their homes. Sharing little life tidbits. It’s just so cute and I want to stay there forever.

You probably don't know that there are still 200 million people in China whose farmer pension is only 120 RMB( $15) per month. And they will just wait and die at home if got some serious illness. These people won't be using Rednote. Some say China's cities  so pretty. that's true. But the reason there are so many new buildings is because government officials and businesspeople can engage in corruption during infrastructure projects, and doing so without Chinese people's consent.

Am I wrong about the issues minorities are facing in China? People are losing their languages. And issues are highly censored. Say Tibet for example, when people talk about the Dalai Lama, Chinese people talk about him like he's a devil, and fierce enemy of the Chinese government. But the thing is their relationship were not always this bad, and in 1979 there was even a delegation from the government in exile sent to China (and was welcomed very enthusiasticly). Discussions about having Dalai Lama return to Tibet was also active at that time, as he was important to the tibetans. Most Chinese kids have ZERO idea of any of this happened",173
