Assistance please with verifying account.,"Hello,

"account banned, how to appeal/reactivate","I got my account banned for whatever security reason they had, and I can still use my account, I just can’t interact with others and dm, and post. I’ve had this account for 3 years, so I don’t just want to give it up, especially when I was banned for something as honestly dumb as this. When I open the app this pop-up comes up, security protection activated, and when I try verifying, they’re ZERO options for foreign passports/anyone living in the US. It’s ridiculous to ban my account, but keep me from reactivating it because I don’t have Chinese residence. So, as a way I’d think would reactivate my account, I verified my identity in my settings with the option of a foreign passport coming up, after 2 weeks of non-stop declining because i didn’t use the right case and format, it finally verified! But guess what, when I try verifying through the pop-up now, my VERIFIED passport on the platform automatically comes up, and when I type in the last 5 digits, click the button, it doesn’t let me complete the form because “It doesn’t support foreign passports”. I’ve already done the customer service chat with people who never actually give you a straight answer, just always constantly avoiding your question, so I’ve given up on that. And, after ages I found out you can appeal your account ban, so I did, 6 minutes later it says it failed, with zero reason or guidance why it did, and I’m now not allowed to reappeal my account because it says “requests too frequent’ when the last I tried to appeal was 5 days ago which was the ONLY time I appealed. I’m coming on here to know if my account is a lost cause, or to know if there’s a genuine way to reactivate my account.",312,

However, I noticed yesterday that my account can send messages again, and Rednote no longer asks me to verify my identity at all!

I’d love to help 1–2 creators for free (just looking to build a small portfolio + learn more about international creator communities).



What I can help with :

* How your niche/content might perform on Xiaohongshu (RED) or Douyin
* Simple positioning suggestions for Chinese audiences
* Adapting your existing IG/TikTok content style for China
* Light caption ideas + trend insights

Why I’m offering this:

I’m genuinely interested in beauty/fashion content and how creators grow across different countries.

I just want hands-on learning + permission to use the experience as a case study.

"I'm a Chinese Social Product Manager (Weibo/Xiaohongshu Logic) - Ask Me Anything about Account Bans, Verification, and Content Moderation!","Hello Guys

I'm an Internet Product Manager and content creator from China. I previously gained deep experience in the operations and mechanism design of major Chinese social platforms, such as Weibo.

I've observed a lot of confusion and frustration regarding RedNote's **account stability**, **real-name verification** (passport/phone number), and **content moderation**. These issues are often tied to the app's underlying logic and the unique regulatory environment of the Chinese internet.

I'd be happy to use my professional perspective to break down these mechanisms and help you better understand and navigate the app.

**Ask Me Anything!**

# == Q&A Summary by Gemini==

If you spot any errors, feel free to DM me.

**TL;DR**: If you want to be a creator on Chinese apps, 

1. You need a Passport. 

2. RedNote and Bilibili are your best bets. 

3. Douyin is currently very restrictive for non-residents.

# Xiaohongshu (RedNote)

**Q1: I don't have a Passport. Can I use my Driver's License or State ID?** 

**A: No.** Chinese platforms cannot access foreign databases (like the DMV or SSN records) to verify if your ID is real. Currently, a **Passport** is the only international document they accept because it is a standard travel document. This is a legal compliance issue, not just a bad UI design.

**Q2: Do I** ***really*** **need to verify? I just want to scroll.** 

**A:**

1. **Restricted Features:** You likely cannot post, comment, or edit your profile fully without it.
2. **High Risk of Ban:** Unverified accounts (especially those created with just an email) are easily flagged as ""High Risk"" or ""Bots"" by the system. If you want to keep the account, **get verified**.

**Q3: I submitted my Passport, but it keeps getting rejected. Why?** 

**A:** The automated system is very sensitive. Try these tips:

* **Use ALL CAPS:** Input your name exactly as it appears on the bottom machine-readable zone (MRZ) of your passport.
* **Check Spacing:** Ensure the spacing between names matches perfectly.
* **Photo Quality:** No glare, full page visible.

**Q4: My account is restricted/frozen even after verification, or says ""Foreign passport not supported."" What do I do?** 

**A:** This is likely a system error. You need manual help:

1. Go to **Me -> Menu (top left) -> Help & Customer Service -> Official Support**.
2. Go to **Account Related -> Login/Account Appeal**.
3. Type **""真人客服""** (copy-paste this, it means ""Live Agent"") repeatedly until a human connects.
4. Explain the situation. They may ask for a photo of you holding your passport to prove you aren't a bot. Wait 48-72 hours.

**Q5: How do I remove a follower without blocking them?** 

**A:** There is no ""Remove"" button. You must: Go to their profile -> Tap the three dots -> **Block** \-> Then go to Settings and **Unblock**. They will be removed from your follower list.

**Q6: My phone number says it is ""Restricted"" or ""Cancelled."" Can I fix it?** 

**A:** Usually, **no.** If a number was linked to a banned account, that number is permanently burned. You cannot use it to register again.

# ⚫️ Douyin (Chinese TikTok)

**Q1: Can I verify my Douyin account to post videos as a foreigner?** 

**A: Currently, it is very difficult.** Douyin tightened its rules in 2024. While it used to work, most users now report that publishing requires a **Chinese Mainland ID**or a **Foreigner's Permanent Residence Permit**. A standard foreign passport often no longer works for enabling posting features on Douyin, unlike RedNote.

**Q2: Why do I get kicked out of Live Streams (Current area not open)?** 

**A:** Many streams are geo-blocked to Mainland China. If you are abroad, you are often blocked from viewing. (VPNs sometimes work, but it's inconsistent).

# 📺 Bilibili & Weibo

**Q1: Is Bilibili foreigner-friendly?** 

**A:** Yes, better than Douyin. They generally accept foreign passports.

# ⚖️ The ""Why"" & Myths

**Q1: Why is this so hard? Is the ""Social Credit Score"" tracking me?** 

**A: No.**

1. **The Law:** The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) requires platforms to verify the *real identity* of all users who can post content.
2. **Risk Control (Not Social Credit):** When you get banned or shadowbanned, it is the platform's internal ""Risk Control Model"" (anti-spam/anti-bot algorithms). It is not a government social credit score monitoring your life.
3. **No Database:** Since they can't check your US/UK/EU government records, they force you to use a Passport or block you to stay safe from liability.

**Q2: Can I bypass this?** 

**A:** For posting? **No.** For viewing only? Maybe, but expect your account to be unstable or frozen eventually if you don't verify.",777,

I have trying to get back to Rednote,"I have been having problems with Rednote and the situation got worst ever since I changed my phone.  When I was on my old phone, things were doing fine for 2 or 3 months until Rednote logged off my account with no reason.  I tried  everything to get my account back, and some days later I got my account back; even though; I had to go through these auto log offs until it did not log me off again.   After  I got my new phone and transferred all the files on it, now I am having problems logging back to Rednote.   Today, after Rednote updated,  I updated the app.  When I opened it, things went back to normal for  a second but I got logged off again.  I tried to log on again and again, and all I got was this message that I have seen before. Note: the message is attached to this message.  The other day, I asked everyone where I can contact Red Note customer  service and how can I verified RedNote without using my passport. Someone told me use WeChat.  I thought Rednote resolved this glitch, but it didn't. Can anyone help me with this problem?

Rednote ID verification,"Recently got hit with this dreaded error, I’m a content creator who was hoping to be able to connect with more friends here in China since my time is spent 50/50 between here and California. 

I currently have 3 proposed solutions and am curious to see if anyone who’s tried battling this with success can chime in.

1. Use my grandmothers mainland ID for verification on this account. 
* Will there be issues with this method or does it seem pretty foolproof? 

2. Use my mothers Hong Kong ID because it’s easier for me to talk to my mom than my grandmother
* Do HK IDs even work for this? If so I might just do it this way.

3. Make a new account (with a new US number since that’s all I have) and verify with my American passport before getting banned 
* Some users report that if you do real name verification with a new account, it gives you the option of using a passport. Is this still true? And if so does it just put me at risk of being banned again later or does it seem pretty reliable? 

Thanks again for help on this topic! And please if you have any questions for me or want to brainstorm I’d be happy to chat. ",220,

At launch, Digital ID acceptance will roll out first in beta at TSA checkpoints at more than 250 airports in the U.S. for in-person identity verification during domestic travel, with additional Digital ID acceptance use cases to come in the future.



Digital ID gives more people a way to create and present an ID in Apple Wallet even if they do not have a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or state ID. Digital ID is not a replacement for a physical passport, and cannot be used for international travel and border crossing in lieu of a U.S. passport.”

WHAT?? Then what’s the point of making giving us the option to do passport verification if they’re not going to let us fully verify anyway?

Do people not use websites in China?,"I have had an account on rednote since back when TikTok was going to be banned and I've stayed because I enjoy seeing how my creative niche is approached in China. 

I'm an artist and I'm not trying to make sales there (or here) but I occasionally get inquiries from people who would like to buy my work anyway. I sell through my own website and my understanding is I'm not allowed to share links on rednote so I don't, but if you know my business name it's very easy to find me on Google. However between the language barrier and different approaches to technology I've had a bunch of really confusing conversations - is using a website rather than an app just a really weird concept in China or is something lost in translation?

Edit: thank you for the explanations and advice! It hadn't occurred to me that my website probably wouldn't work well (if at all) in China, even if I managed to share it without being flagged by rednote, or that paying with a credit card would be off putting. If anyone inquires in the future I'll just explain that I can't sell to China because my website won't work there and skip trying to direct anyone to it. ",219,

Has anyone gotten sudden spam calls?,"(Edit) to whoever is downvoting this post… this is for you: 

* this exact same scam is a known scam operation that specifically targets Chinese people living in foreign countries. They always claim to be from the FCC or some similar American government agency, ask if you speak Chinese, and then start telling you about how you are in some sort of legal trouble in China (your information was stolen in China, you are connected to some made up criminal in China, etc.)
* These specific scammers got my info from somewhere…  a lot of people mentioned WeChat as the probable source of their leaked information. I recently used WeChat to try to authenticate/link-to my Rednote account (didn’t work…). So it might not be rednote, but I don’t know for sure and I’m hoping someone else knows more about how they get my info… 
* From what I heard, these scammers are looking for Chinese people living abroad who have ties to China, and therefore might be worried if they are in supposed “legal trouble” back home. 
* I have absolutely no ties to Chinese statehood. All family members that are Chinese citizens have since died… I was born and raised abroad… 

To preserve my anonymity, I’ll just use these random words to represent my last name, just to tell the story: Hypothetical last name is 白. Anglicized Mandarin: Bai. Anglicized Shanghainese (not my dialect lol): Beih. On my hypothetical government documents, Beih is the ONLY last name that has ever existed for me. My last name is always spelled in English and never written in Chinese characters. 

I get a few repeated phone calls from this Washington DC area code (202) number. I know it’s probably a scam, so I ignore them. They keep calling, so I pick up and entertain them for a bit… 

This (very) obviously Chinese man says he is from the FCC or something. Honestly I could barely understand his spoken English, so I only registered that it was some official sounding agency… 

I ask him what he is calling about, and he asks if I can speak Chinese. I’m obviously thinking…. wtf is this? Anyway he can tell I am confused, so he says you are Mr/Ms Bai (mandarin) right? You can speak Chinese? 

Anyway, I said I can’t speak Chinese, and this guy hung up… 

But seriously… “my” last name is Beih… this guy called me Bai… 

If I had to guess, someone who is a native Chinese speaker saw my information which included my official last name “Beih”, and then either knew the dialect or searched the name online… and called me by the mandarin name “Bai”… I don’t have any official documents using Chinese characters, so the only last name I have is the anglicized spelling of the Chinese dialect… 

ANYWAY, does anyone have some guesses on what these people are trying to do? Who are they trying to target anyway? And how did they get my information…. Recently I tried to submit verification on WeChat… do you guys think that could be the leak?

Where did those cross-border conversations on Rednote go earlier this year?,"I’m a Chinese user. Earlier this year (around January 2025), my Rednote feed was suddenly full of really friendly cross-country posts — people from China and other countries chatting, comparing notes, and doing “duìzhàng” (cross-checking media stories). I really loved that time — the atmosphere was open, curious, and genuinely kind, and honestly, I felt excited scrolling through it every day. But that didn’t last long — within about two weeks, those posts basically disappeared from my feed, and I stopped seeing users from other countries altogether. Did something change with the algorithm, moderation, or regional settings? Or did international users just stop posting? If you’re using Rednote from outside China, what does your feed look like now? Are there any tags, keywords, or settings that still surface those cross-border conversations? Just curious about what changed — not trying to start any political argument.",155,

Guys, I have solved it 🙂‍↕️ This is how: Do your “Real name verification” -> I got approved by writing in this order: FIRST, MIDDLE,SURNAME (in all capitals).  If you are still restricted after getting approved, like I was, go to -> “Help center” -> “Acc check” -> click the red button (to check what is wrong), mine said that they found abnormal activity so they restricted it, so I had to click the “unblock button” -> pick manual verification” -> click “real name verification issue” (you have to translate because everything is in mandarin, I used google Gemini) , make a short comment that you need help lifting the restrictions (use ChatGPT to translate it), and apply a picture of you holding your passport next to you & one with only your passport -> submit.

Why did RedNote make itself so accessible to foreigners only to later kick us all off?,"I assumed the idea was to expand Chinese soft power abroad. But then with how the app is treating foreigners now, its almost a complete reversal in direction it feels like.

A desperate plea from a restricted American to pass along a message.,"Hey everyone, longtime lurker that never really needed a reason to post until today.  

A few weeks ago, I downloaded XHS to see if I could just get a glimpse into the life of regular Chinese people, and what I found there was so much more than that. What began as me just wanting to take a look at life in China developed into a social atmosphere where I felt I could truly be myself and connect with others, all thanks to the warm and welcoming people I met on the app. I was taken aback and inspired by how many ordinary Chinese people were using XHS to practice their English, work on speaking with each other, and asking questions regarding grammatical or pronunciation issues they were having.  

As someone who has taught my girlfriend and several friends many basics of the English language after they came to the US, I figured I would see if anyone on XHS would be interested in practicing their English with me, since it’s something I enjoy taking part in and I can really appreciate the effort people put in. I ended up adding a few friends so that they could practice with me through DM’s, and I found one person who practices on live stream sessions every morning. I joined her stream and she was ecstatic to have a native speaker who wanted to help her and her 5 viewers learn. She even invited me to connect my audio and we chatted for a while, it was honestly kind of surreal given how people are on most social media out here. I assured her and whoever else was their that I would absolutely love to make this a regular thing, since she practices at 6:30am in her local time, which is always free for me.  

Right after I left the stream my account was restricted like many others here, and until my passport comes in, it appears I am out of luck. I am reaching out here to see if anyone would be kind enough to pass along a message to the one new friend letting them know what happened. I have an idea of what I want to say, and I can send you the text and you can modify if it needed if what I have typed makes your weary at all, but it is nothing bad. I basically just want to let her know that this was unintentional, and I am working on a way to continue using the app and getting back in touch so we can continue practicing together.  

Thank you in advance to anyone who took the time to read this. Being restricted from this app has honestly really saddened me. In all honesty, tears welled in my eyes when support confirmed there’s nothing they could do after some frankly embarrassing pleas (I got a real human after a while and they were very sympathetic fwiw). I could be banned from any other social media and not care, but I was actually really connecting with people on XHS, and thinking of the possibility that I may never be able to speak to these people again and they will think I just flaked on them pains me.  

Also, just to clarify, this is not a romantic thing or anything of that nature, at all, and there was no money or anything involved. I just want to let them know I’m sorry for disappearing out of nowhere and I am actively working on a way to get back in touch with them. ",605,

Restricted rednote account even after verification,"Hi all! I am wondering if anybody else has had a similar issue and even a potential solution to offer. I created a Rednote account and was asked to verify using my foreign passport. Whilst doing this, I didn’t fully understand the instruction and on the first attempt I typed my name in as I normally would: “Conor”. The verification failed and on the second attempt I correctly typed it as per the instructions which stated to type it exactly as it was on my passport: “CONOR” in all upper case.

I passed verification however my account got restricted from posting, commenting, or messaging right after this… I appealed on multiple occasions and went through customer service and everything (which was a real ache as most of it is AI interfaced) and every single time my appeal fails. I’ve provided full explanations and evidence of verification. It’s been such a hassle and I’ve been stuck in a loop of customer service and appeals that lead nowhere, all because of a genuine minor mistake that I corrected very quickly AND got approved okay on in the end.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Do you think just continuing to appeal will eventually work or is there another way I can get this fixed? Or is this a lost cause entirely? 🥲😅",226,

Some context I am diaspora Shanghainese who does not normally interact with the old country; doesn't use wechat etc. I am fluent in Shanghainese but cannot speak Mandarin. However, I thought I should probably reconnect with the old country, so I started using Rednote 2 days ago. 

  
I searched for ""Shanghainese"" and found a post on Shanghainese writing (it was top rated): [http://xhslink.com/o/4YxSYTK7dx4](http://xhslink.com/o/4YxSYTK7dx4)  
I only interacted with this one post. I posted 2 comments on this post; one in English and one in Chinese. Two days later, my account was flagged. I checked my comments. They had deleted my Chinese comment and muted my English one (see picture below for the English comment).   
For the Chinese one I provided a translation of the text asked by the OP.  


>Picture 3: 善惡經。 耶穌一千八百五十六年。郟娘娘。。。

What triggered this? Was it the use of traditional Chinese or was it the topic? Also why was it so inconsistently applied?

HOW TO GET REDNOTE VERIFICATION CODE,"I have been trying to get a code for the last week and had no luck UNTIL…

I downloaded the textPlus app (green logo). Make a phone number with them. It’s completely free. Then use that number to get the verification code. I got the code instantly and I can finally remove my government name from this app 😭. You’re welcome.

For context I’m based in USA, made the red note account with my Apple ID, and made another USA number on textplus ",89,
is this a common thing?,"hi i downloaded xhs some time ago to look art and photos like how i use pinterest for inspiration. i follow artists but i don't post anything

a few artists with quite a lot of followers followed me back and asked me if i like drawing. it all sounded similar so at first i was confused. but the conversation usually stops after i reply a bit (maybe i'm just dry texter 💀)

to be fair i had art from a web series called alien stage on my profile, which i thought was fairly well-known at least in an app usually used for art. maybe they assumed this was my art, so i would tell them it's not my art + also put this in my bio to avoid any confusion but i haven't been unfollowed or anything

Login again to Rednote/ 小红书,"Hi guys ~ I come because I had a problem with my account on Rednote.I saw I've 2 apps of Rednote one is for foreigners and the second one is the original one is Xiaohongshu (小红书 app) Then out of blue I logged out. But thankfully I logged in again and returned my account by follow these tips: 

First of all check your phone number (if it still works or suspended from the company) >> Click on it and check it >> uninstall Rednote app and install it again >> Stop trying at the same day or the whole day (try that in different day) >> Now register your phone number that you used for Rednote >> Type your password (I guess you already saved it on your phone). Last but not least Check out the tips on the picture that I posted. 

📢 Noted: This is how I solved my problem in that case 

For you as you see .. there are different ways to login again if you have one of these apps and if you linked them with same username of your Rednote's account and phone number

How i have kept some communication after the block,"So a few days ago I've been blocked from doing any messaging and some of my friends from China noticed. I changed my bio to include the message that I couldn't message. What I noticed is that one thing I could do was pin messages and once unpinned was able to leave a notification message. So one friend I made notices and figured out that 1 message means yes and I means no.

For another friend I've stayed contact, we've been developing the for of communicating by using my saves. Since people are trying to learn English I've saved words and then structure my sentences so that I can send some form of message and then pin the message to let them know I was done. 

It's very difficult but it's how I've managed, so try it in case you really need to message your friend",155,
This is currently speculation on my part...,"... But with XHS getting summoned and penalized by the Cyberspace Authority of China on September 11, 2025, I do suspect that they will be walling off the app to foreigners by the end of the year (my guess).

I had noticed that my FYP hadn't changed and I wasn't getting a lot of authentic content that I was use to when that unofficialCEO guy with the hat had made a post about a new version of the app maybe being released which caused me to go into a rabbit hole of stuff. One of which was finding out that Big Daddy Data called XHS in their office. 

Another thing I looked at was that I'm the Google Store, the app title is now in Chinese and no longer reads as just ""Rednote."" I did double check through Wayback Machine to make sure I wasn't crazy but as of September 11, they changed their Google store title to be in Chinese.

Right now, I expect users are noticing something with their FYPs.  I hadn't been getting very good content and so started to dig around. And then I turned off auto translate... And then my FYP was much better.

It can be inferred that the AI auto translating tools are actually moderating, filtering and funneling content so that international users may be seeing more curated content compared to authentic content. It also works the same with the Domestic users and they may be seeing less of your content. This would be referred to as a ""soft split."" 

I am guessing that by the end of the year or sooner, they will be walling off the international users. ",284,

If I was banned for replying too fast to my fans then don’t even reply or unban me, I don’t want anything to do with the app if that’s the case. if it was worse please let me know what happened, I just want to understand, and maybe try again, but it just sucks seeing all of the cool new friends, YES JUST FRIENDS, that I made, all disappearing and I will never be able to talk to them again.

Rednote is telling me that publishing a video I filmed and edited is violating their protocols.,"I started gathering fans on Rednotes. I guess somehow that rattles their cage. In the most recent post, I posted but forgot to claim ownership - as you have to select a whole bunch of shit to claim the originality.  Well, I forgot when I published the post. And then, I went back in to make changes. It then suspended my account. I then appealed by just saying 'I violated nothing' as I was pissed off and upset., without uploading any evidence. To my surprise,  my appeal was succesful - like who the f\*ck is processing those appeals. 

In the meantime, while I was waiting, I uploaded my IDs. Not sure if that helped. 

I called their service hotline from Australia and was then redirected to the APP. 

After I was told my appeal was successful, I checked my a/c on the laptop browser, I could see that all the posts I posted so far had a mark that says 'violated/breached'. Like what the F\*ck they are trying to say or do.....or expect me to do?

On one hand, you accepted my appeal; on the other, you are saying I've breached something.

I am gonna f\*cking complain every f\*cking day through their f\*cking app. I just try to make a point that their censorship systems - automatic or not, are a bunch of crap!

I faced this issue last Thursday and it was a mess, I was restricted from messaging, commenting, posting, modifying my profile.

Additionally, they wanted me to provide them with my id proof which I don't have but somehow after filing appeals, feedbacks I was able to get my account back completely day before yesterday.

Today I realised, it's not just me but many other foreigners who are slowly getting banned even if they provide or don't provide a real id proof.There's no guarantee.

It's just sad I have spent 5 months on the app, made 2 good chinese friends and now I feel like I might eventually lose them as there's no guarantee that my account is completely safe, I might get banned again and eventually lose it and even if I create a new one I'll still have to provide them an id proof which I don't have.",205,

Do you use the Pomodoro Technique? I’m building an AI Pomodoro Buddy – what would you want from it?,"Hey everyone 👋



I’m working on a side project that combines the Pomodoro Technique with AI – kind of like a *Pomodoro Buddy*. Think of it as a virtual coach + accountability partner + a bit of a chill co-worker you can talk to. 🍅💬



The idea is to make it more than just a timer:



* It reminds you to start when you’re procrastinating
* It cheers you on during focus sprints
* It logs what you actually worked on
* It gives you little summaries or nudges based on your patterns
* Maybe even works with others in a co-focus session





I’m currently shaping the first version and would love your input:

👉 If you use Pomodoro already, what frustrates you about current apps or timers?

👉 If you had an “AI Pomodoro Buddy,” what would you want it to *do* or *say*?

👉 Would you want it to be silent and minimal, or more chatty and interactive?



Any thoughts or feature dreams are super welcome. Thanks!",188,

How do u feel Rednote in June?,"As a Chinese user, I still remember that morning in mid-January when I woke up and saw that some of my fellow students from USYD had created an online meeting on Rednote to welcome Western users. In the days leading up to Chinese New Year, I had many fascinating conversations with people from incredibly diverse backgrounds — those experiences left a lasting impression on me.

However, by the time February arrived, about half of the English content had disappeared. During that time, I helped a few users deactivate their Rednote accounts, which was also the first time I saw the log-off page. I soon became familiar with the steps for logging out and was able to offer advice to some users — not only because Chinese is my native language, but also because I understand the mindset of Chinese tech companies.

Yes, I know many users in this community came here as TikTok ""refugees"" but have since returned. Still, I'm genuinely curious: how do you feel about Rednote now?",176,

 **1. Why does tiktok refugees use the #cat tax method to communicate with Chinese people on Rednote?**

 **2. Also, what is the impact of this communication method on Tiktok refugees themseleves? What is the impact on the Rednote platform? (e.g. impact on your mood / if you have a pet is there any difference it would make onto your relationship with them / ...)**",125,

Can't see a person's account but I'm not blocked,"Like the title says, when I click a person's account, It blocks me from seeing their posts, and searching for them won't do anything as well. It's happened to me twice now, one with a nail artist and the other with a bjd account.

But I know I'm not blocked bcuz the posts I have saved are still there (both the nail artist's and the bjd doll's posts).

And, I've been blocked before (cuz I didn't have my age on my account when i followed them). And the person that blocked me, obviously, the posts I saved from them are gone.

Also, for anybody wondering, all I do on my rednote account is save posts, maybe like a few things, might follow a couple of people. I don’t comment, dm, anything of the sort. Bcuz I don’t know Chinese, and also my phone number doesn't work, I think, for the confirmation account thing, so I can't change my account, nothing.

Soo, how do I fix this, or do I just put a review and pray that they fix this part of the app??

Tiktok Refugees brought Grooming culture to Rednote🤬,"Caught a pedo in two youth chatrooms on mic grooming girls, his M.O. is to befriend them in chatrooms then move to DMs. His bio states 19yr old but his voice betrays him, contrast with his following and followers which are mostly adolescent girls.  
  
In one instance, he said he likes Chinese girls then got rejected, he lashes out by claiming all Chinese girls are gold diggers then brag about having a Chinese gf. Chatroom hosts are too naive and polite to kick him, but said they recently encountered many like him.  
  
The algorithm will rarely serve youth chatrooms to normal adults, so if you happen to see pedos please stop to help, save the evidence and report them! My previous note on this topic was removed after the p3do reported it, he promptly DMed me to gloat.

This Is Why You Should NOT Trust The Chinese SNS Rednote,"This is about someone—me—who tried to protect myself and my content, only to get punished for it.

I shared a personal thought on Rednote about how it feels to speak Japanese after spending a long time in Japan. The post resonated with many people and gained some attention. But then, out of nowhere, a user sent me a direct message:  
**“You don’t even fit in, and you still run your mouth?”**

It made me deeply uncomfortable. So, I posted a follow-up, saying something like:  
**“This person is so rude. Be careful.”**

Guess what? Rednote flagged *my* post, saying:  
**“Your notes involve sarcasm, defamation, verbal abuse, personal attacks, or the exposure of others' private information.”**

In other words, I was warned for simply speaking up about being insulted.

That’s how Rednote operates. They don’t actually deal with the root of the issue or look into the context. They just make a judgment call based on their own logic—and that’s final.

I didn’t do anything harmful. I didn’t attack anyone. All I did was call out inappropriate behavior. But in the end, *I* got warned for it.

So yeah, if you think Rednote is a fair platform—think again.",207,

Thesis Survey on the Mass Exodus of TikTok Users to RedNote,"Hey guys, i am not sure whether i am allowed to ask for help on this community.

I am currently writing my bachelor thesis and would appreciate it if you could take part in my survey.

The survey aims to explore whether social media users prefer non-domestic apps over domestic alternatives due to sociopolitical motivations, cultural curiosity, or resistance to government interference. 

A recent example of this is the potential TikTok ban in the U.S. Where at its peak, 3.4 million U.S. users switched to RedNote (Xiaohongshu).

Real Name Verification Passport Full Name Question/Uncertainty,"Hey everyone, for those who've done Real name verification. I'm using my passport (non Chinese) and I have 2 questions.

In Rednote's ""Full name"" field, should I follow the passport formula and write in LAST NAME FIRST NAME MIDDLE NAME as it appears (sorta) on my passport? Or does it even matter?

2. My last name is Irish and on my passport the ""Mc"" and ""The Rest"" are 2 separate words. There's a space in the middle. Like it would say MC GUIRE.

Help! What am I supposed to do about this?,,9,
What I've learned to create my community on Xiaohongshu,"I signed up on Xiaohongshu on January 13 before TikTok ban was supposed to happen. I taught myself a brief intro in Mandarin, posted it along with three other older videos I had recorded for American platforms with added subtitles, and things skyrocketed from there.

For anyone struggling to gain traction, this is what I've learned so far:

1. **There's** ***some*** **luck involved**. Other larger creators have mentioned this in interviews or in their own videos, and I believe this now because on US platforms I've barely managed to claw my way up to 15K followers combined between YouTube, Meta, and TikTok (where my largest US following is at 10.9K). Eventually, you post that one video that goes viral and you have to take full advantage of the momentum from there. For me, it just happened to have occurred on Xiaohongshu.

2. **Read the room.** Every social media platform has its own culture. As many others have noted, for Americans, Xiaohongshu is like a mix of Instagram and Pinterest, and is also used as a search engine. So people are looking to learn something from your content, whether it's about your lifestyle, culture, or hobby. Post with the intention of giving your fans some educational value based the focus of your content.

3. **Be genuine**. This should go without saying. Relax and be yourself. Don't worry about what other people think. There's an audience out there for everyone.

4. **Content quality.** A number of comments about my videos have been about the quality, presumably from both an educational and production perspective. I use a cinematic style of shooting, so I take advantage of natural light as much as I possibly can. I seldom use studio/auxiliary lighting. I don't use a teleprompter, either. I take bullet notes of the main points I wanna talk about and I wing it from there, so the dialogue is more authentic.

To be fair, I used to be in a public speaking club so that's helped me be quick on my feet with improvising dialogue. Also, one piece of advice that I learned from a YouTuber that has helped me do way less takes--when you record, pretend you're live, because when you're live, you have to keep going and you don't get to start over. This has helped me be more natural with my dialogue.

What I personally emphasize almost as much as the video audio, so I invested in a wireless lav mic for dialogue and a shotgun mic to capture environmental sounds for my b-roll footage. I use licensed music from a subscription service for my  background music.

5. **English speakers: Speak clearly, concisely, and caption your videos!** Many of my fans have admitted they follow me to practice their English, so I've learned to speak more clearly and steadily. Avoid using filler words to collect your thoughts like ""um"", ""uh"", ""like"", and ""you know"". ""So"" and ""and"" can also be filler words if you're using them to collect your thoughts.

Speaking clear and grammatically correct English will make captions so much easier. Avoid slang, because it doesn't translate well. Caption your videos in English and *simplified Chinese*. I use CapCut Pro for this. I believe Adobe Premiere already offers this, as well as Final Cut Pro (but will require a Mac with Apple silicon). For my video titles and descriptions, I use ChatGPT or DeepSeek to translate.

For English speakers, it's more work to create content for Xiaohongshu, but for me it's been well worth the extra effort, and I hope it works for you, too. Please note that I still have much more to learn. I've been creating content occasionally since 2020, but I really started paying attention to details after my completely unexpected engagement on Xiaohongshu. I hope my experience so far helps some of you continue to create for this amazing community.",652,

I got a Chinese name? How is it? My name is Esmeralda,"李诗雅

Li Shi Ya

MEANING:

1. Name Overview:

The name '#i#' (Li Shi Ya) is a harmonious blend of cultural depth and phonetic similarity to 'Esmeralda'. It carries a poetic elegance and embodies qualities of grace, artistry, and natural beauty.

2. Surname Analysis:

The surname '\*' (Li) is one of the most common Chinese surnames, symbolizing strength and resilience. It was chosen for its widespread recognition and the balance it brings to the overall name.

3. Given Name Characters:

\- First character 'i' (Shi): Meaning 'poetry', this character reflects a love for literature and the arts, suggesting a person of refined taste and creativity. - Second character '7#' (Ya): Meaning 'elegant' or 'graceful', this character emphasizes the bearer's dignified and sophisticated nature.

4. Cultural Significance:

The name '#i#' embodies the Chinese appreciation for the arts and the natural elegance found in poetry and grace. It reflects a deep cultural respect for beauty, both in nature and in human character.

5. Sound Adaptation:

The name creatively adapts the sounds of 'Esmeralda' through the use of 'i' (Shi) and 'It' (Ya), which together mimic the soft, flowing sounds of the original name while maintaining a distinctly Chinese identity.

6. Poetic Quality:

The characters 'I' and 'I#' work together to create a name that is not only beautiful in sound but also rich in meaning. The combination suggests a person who is both artistically inclined and naturally graceful, embodying the poetic and elegant qualities that are highly valued in Chinese culture.

How RedNote is perceived by Chinese people,"So I am from China but currently live in the U.S. I am a casual user of RedNote: never posted anything, but spend maybe 1-2 hours every week scrolling on average. When I discovered this sub I was quite surprised that the perception of RedNote here is overwhelmingly positive — in fact much more positive than how this app is perceived in China, which is esp. surprising since Reddit is sort of an “anti-China” platform in general.

It seems that there has been little discussion here on how Chinese people view RedNote, and I figured that this might be interesting to some. I will try to be neutral but obviously everyone has their own bias. Below is how (from my understanding) RedNote is perceived in China in general, not necessarily my own opinion (although I do share some of those general views).

Tl;dr — The perception of RedNote in China is similar to the perception of Instagram in the U.S.: some view it as a friendly and positive platform, while others believe it is toxic and the positivity is mostly fake.

1. RedNote is primarily known as an app where middle-class people in tier 1 or tier 2 cities share their semi-upscale lives, and consumerism is rampant there. People say that if your net worth is less than 2m USD (or some similar number) then you are dirt poor on RedNote. What’s more, a large portion of the lifestyle on RedNote is actually fake. There is a famous joke that Maserati sold 4,220 cars in China in 2020, yet 7,600 people on RedNote shared their “newly purchased Maserati cars” on RedNote in the same year (I did not verify whether this was true). There are also a lot of fake luxury clothes/handbags (“on RedNote one owns an Hermès birkin bag on average”).

2. Because of (1), many people get anxious on Rednote. Just search “小红书 焦虑” (“RedNote anxiety”) and a huge amount of relevant contents will pop up. Scroll for 20mins and you will think you are poorer, uglier, and less successful than everyone else.

3. There is a disproportionately large number of Chinese people overseas on RedNote, esp. those in the U.S. and Canada. As such, RedNote has perhaps the best “life in the U.S.” type posts among all Chinese social media. Even for mid-size, not-tourist-heavy cities such as Portland, OR and Salt Lake City, UT, there are a lot of relevant posts. (But if you go down to the level of, say, Boise, ID, then there are very few contents.)

4. RedNote is also known as a useful search engine. It might sound ridiculous that a picture/short video platform is viewed by many as the No.1 search engine, but since Google is blocked in China and Baidu returns mostly garbage results, many people have to rely on RedNote. RedNote is especially useful for daily-life issues, such as “how to fix the toilet”. A lot of Chinese people in the U.S. also use RedNote to search for information about life in the U.S., which is kind of weird since Reddit definitely has much more stuff (see (3)). I guess some people just prefer posts in the Chinese language.

5. The algorithm of RedNote is super sensitive: say you just searched for “Sichuan travel” once, then it will push such contents to you again and again unless you click “not interested”. Because of this, some say RedNote has the worst echo chamber among all Chinese social media. But on the other hand, once you “raise your account properly” (this is how we say it in the Chinese language), the app will consistently show you posts on topics that you are really interested in.

6. Somewhat ironically, many RedNote users themselves consider RedNote toxic and view Reddit as friendly. Just search “Reddit” on RedNote and the resulting posts are very positive in general. People say Reddit is fun, a great place to practice your English, and reflects the U.S. culture well.

Of course, Reddit users only represent a specific group of people in the U.S. (and other mostly English-speaking countries). But that is also the case for RedNote users in China. I think RedNote really provided an invaluable window for American people (and other people in the West) to see *a portion of* the lives of regular Chinese people — just like I frequently learn aspects of American culture on Reddit. But again just like Reddit, RedNote only represents a certain subgroup of Chinese people, and its vibe in no way reflects life in China in general.",763,

ANIMAL ABUSE,"I recently switched from TikTok to Red Note and loved it. It felt safe, and I enjoyed the animal posts.

My breaking point came when I saw a bucket crammed with hamsters—so packed they couldn’t move, lie down, or access food and water. People were calling it cute, but it was clearly animal abuse. I finally spoke up, saying, “This isn’t cute. They’re suffering.” Afterward, I had to meditate for 30 minutes just to clear my head.

Lost access to my account - Help!,"Hi All, Looking for some assistance..!

I lost access to [my account](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/user/profile/673ee2d5000000001c01ae4e) recently because I changed phones, and I'm unable to regain access. The situation was that I can't exactly recall which email address and/or phone number I used during sign up.  I've tried what I thought were some pretty likely options (e.g. the most likely 2 or 3 email addresses, the most likely 2 or 3 numbers) but so far I haven't struck gold.

I am able to prove I am who I am as my face is in all the videos and it really isn't hard for me to do some facial verification.

I've also submitted a form from the help section on the xiaohongshu app requesting assistance on regaining access, but I was only able to leave a phone number behind and I wasn't logged in when I did it and I haven't heard back. I've also already tried the ""regain access to lost account"" function in the help section, but it keeps rejecting my ID, with some error message like ""please enter correct ID"" appearing.

Sharing this in messaging apps can be inconvenient because built-in video/photo previews may be lost when the message contains both words and a URL.

Does anyone else feel RedNote's content could be more in-depth?,"Hi everyone!

I've been using RedNote for a while now, and while I appreciate the platform and some of the content, I've noticed a trend that's leaving me a little unsatisfied. I'm finding that a lot of the information feels a bit superficial. It's great for a quick overview, but it doesn't really delve deep enough to truly enrich my learning experience.

I'm wondering if others feel the same way? Are you hoping for more insightful and comprehensive content?

I've seen some articles on RedNote about fat burning, but they tend to just scratch the surface. They might mention general tips like ""eat healthy and exercise,"" but they don't go into the science behind fat burning, discuss different training methodologies (HIIT vs. LISS, for example), or explore the role of hormones and nutrition in a detailed way. I'd love to see content that explores these aspects more deeply, perhaps with links to scientific studies or expert opinions.

I understand that RedNote might be aiming for a broad audience, but I think there's definitely a demand for more in-depth content. Perhaps they could offer different tiers of content, or create more specialized sections for those who want to dive deeper into specific subjects.

What are your thoughts? Do you feel RedNote's content could be more insightful?",225,

Maybe it's just happening to me (or to people like me who have accounts on both), but I didn't really get any Chinese content (from actual Chinese creators) before this.

Yeah..... the vibe ain't right atm,"**TL;DR Algorithm yeeted my preferences again and is feeding me stuff I don't care for. (But this is not a ""I'm deleting the app"" post; I'm just disappointed.)**

A couple of days ago I made a post about how my FYP completely changed from having a lot of my interests on it (art, food, books, etc., and all in Mandarin, very few subtitles) to suddenly being thumbnail after thumbnail of Chinese women showing their bodies in *specific* postures (mostly their butts). I mentioned how I have zero interest in this and did not even tap on those videos but tried very quickly to address the issue by searching for the content I'm interested in.

TWO DAYS LATER, after my FYP had been fixed, we're back to the t\*ts and \*ss.

I'm not sure what's going on with XHS's algorithm, or how they determine what viewers of a certain sex/age receive on their FYP, but I've been using XHS for longer than most Americans (before ""TikTok migration"") and I've never had this problem.

It's very sad, honestly, because I feel like my experience of the app is being influenced by factors completely out of my control, and that's just not how these sorts of apps are supposed to function. My ""Follow"" page, thankfully, still has all the people I follow, and I'm doing as a user recommended and just gone on there and furiously hit ""LIKE LIKE LIKE"" on everything there. And that has (probably temporarily) fixed my FYP again. But as I scrolled down further, I noticed two or three of these ""softcore p0rn"" videos already rearing their heads among my preferred content. I marked them as ""Not Interested"" so I'm *really really* hoping that does something.

If it doesn't, well... it's been a good one guys. I'll keep coming back on here for any potential news of the algorithm becoming much better, and I won't uninstall or anything, but yeah, can't really use the app if the content just isn't for me.",339,
Has anyone else notice a spike in their data usage?,"Ever since I downloaded RedNote, I ended up using about 20-25% more data than usual, despite not heavily using the app. Has anyone else had this issue?

Any non-Chinese users here who never actually used TikTok?,"I never used TikTok - I tried it out once for like 10 minutes a few years ago and promptly deleted it. I downloaded RedNote due to all the hype, and I instantly found it much better than TikTok. I've always been interested in foreign countries, including China, and I've found RedNote to be a fascinating window into Chinese culture, mindsets, etc. To be honest, that's the main appeal.

I recently re-downloaded TT just to compare and yep, TT is much worse. I swear the algorithm is actually harder for me to curate as it tends to consistently insist on recommending brainrot despite my best efforts, while I was able pretty quickly to cultivate RedNote to serve me contents of higher quality on average.

So yeah, anyone come over during the ""refugee"" rush who actually isn't a refugee? ",147,
Algorithm total Bait & Switch moment,"Yooooo... I had been on XHS since before the big ""migration"", and I only follow Chinese creators who make art, play music, read books. Naturally, I was watching (and liking) a lot of videos related to CNY, but these were all videos about how CNY is celebrated in villages and so on.

Today, I opened the app after not being on it for one day, and my entire FYP is just a bunch of posts of Asian women showing their chests and butts in one way or another. I don't even follow or engage with gym/fitness accounts.

I swear, it feels like a 13yo took over my XHS for a few hours and had a one-handed celebration with the app.

Effective Tips to Address Racial and Nationality Discrimination on Rednote,"First, it's important to acknowledge that discrimination based on race, specific nationalities, and sexual orientation does exist in Chinese society, as well as among Rednote users. Despite Rednote's extensive efforts to control this, it cannot be entirely avoided. All the following suggestions are based on this premise.

* Avoid posting content that solely emphasizes your racial identity without any other substantive information. 
   * Rednote's algorithm tends to favor posts that attract users who are more willing to leave comments and engage with the creator. This is why Rednote's community maintains a friendly atmosphere for discussion. If a post's only substantive content is about racial identity, it will attract those who are more motivated to comment on such issues, and these individuals are more likely to be racially biased. From another perspective, it's as if the creator is actively attracting these people.
* Hiding your identity can make online interactions more comfortable. 
   * Have you noticed that Chinese users prefer using cartoon avatars and nicknames instead of their real names? Many even opt for system-default names like ""momo."" This is because on Rednote, people desire an environment free from identity-related pressures. Of course, many Chinese users do this to avoid awkwardness from family, classmates, or colleagues. Everyone understands the reasoning behind using virtual avatars and names, and it is not considered impolite. While anonymity can often increase aggressiveness and bring out the worst in people, Rednote's community atmosphere and algorithmic mechanisms effectively counteract this.
* Report discriminatory comments instead of engaging in arguments. 
   * Please understand that a person's negative, hostile, or aggressive comments towards you are determined by their own perceptions and current state of mind. There will always be such individuals in society, and the greater the societal pressure, the more such people there will be. It has nothing to do with your identity or behavior. Arguing with someone in a bad state of mind is a poor choice. Deleting comments, reporting, and blocking are more effective methods. This also helps Rednote's algorithm better understand what matters to you.
* Share more details about your profession and daily life, especially advice that can be helpful to others. 
   * I've seen many people receive a lot of useful advice from China through Rednote, including tips on cooking and alleviating menstrual pain. This is the type of content that Rednote users enjoy the most. Through these exchanges, Chinese users have also noticed gaps in areas like music and fitness compared to the U.S. If American friends are willing to share advice in these fields, you will receive more friendly and warm feedback.",441,

A Chinese Perspective on Western Fear of China,"I saw a TikTok where someone shared how spending a few days on red note made them realize the Western bias in China coverage. They pointed out it’s not just about China’s rise but its ideology threatening capitalism.

As a Chinese person living in Australia for almost 20 years, I can’t deny that Western media coverage of China is often heavily biased, and it’s hard not to sense an underlying agenda. After reading extensively, I feel that one of the most significant, if not the sole, reasons Western politicians work so hard to spread fear of China and the CCP is that China represents something that could challenge the foundational ideology of Western civilization—socialism.

When liberty encounters fairness and justice, when “universal values” meet human liberation, and when the West begins to understand the unity and efficiency underlying China’s system, their worldview and perspectives may be forever altered.

Don’t get me wrong—I live in Australia and still believe it is a wonderful place. However, it’s a shame that Eastern and Western civilizations have never had the opportunity to truly sit down, understand one another, and work together for the future of humanity. This aligns with the core value of China’s rooting culture: 世界大同 (universal harmony).

As I finish typing this comment, I realize that if I were looking at it from a Western perspective, I might feel frightened or skeptical. Yet, this reflects the genuine Chinese mindset. 

It’s a real pity that the two ends of the world may remain unable to understand each other in the foreseeable future.

Edit:

I feel it’s a bit too pessimistic to just end the post there and decided to put a close on a more hopeful note.

The recent cultural exchanges between Western netizens on platforms like Red Note are, ever so slightly, opening the door for real communication. These exchanges offer a rare chance for Western and Eastern cultures to learn from each other, break down misconceptions, and open their minds to new perspectives.

It’s small, but it’s a start. Maybe one day, this connection will grow into something bigger—a world where understanding replaces fear. That’s something worth hoping for.",366,

Why is RedNote not popular? Only 0.5% use it,"There are 170 million Americans who use TikTok actively monthly. Due to the recent ban of TT some migrated off to RedNote or Xiaohongshu. But this number isnt as big as people think

**Only 7 million** at best are using RedNote in America, this is about **0.5% of all American TikTok users.** 

This tells us that despite people hating on US government and META rightfully so are okay with moving over to Instagram than to use RedNote. 

Another Reason is that RedNote translations tools are pale in comparison to what TikTok offers, and META being the cheater cuck that is has alrady copied most of these original ByteDance tools into Reels

Another reason could be that RedNote itself isnt big in china, only 300 million Chinese use it compared to 1 billion WeChat or Douyin users. This is just 30%  of all chinese intenet users

Another reason is that RedNote algorith sucks and isnt as good as TikTok but still much better than the garbage of Youtube shorts or Instagram

My thoughts about life and America/China after using this app,"This app has opened me up to a new way of thinking. Honestly, I am humbled by how much I didn’t know about Chinese culture. I like to think of myself as a decently informed person with cultural competence, and I think I am more globally aware than most Americans (which doesn’t say much lol). I like to research countries, but I never really cared about China. I knew it had 1.4 billion people, but it didn’t register to me just how many people that was. That’s so many people who are living a life with completely different mindsets and values to the western world I was brought up in. 

I went in very guarded and suspicious of “Chinese propaganda,” expecting them to aggressively instill their way of life onto me, because if it was the other way around, that’s exactly what Americans would do. I also went in arrogant, thinking us Americans would show the Chinese people what it’s like to live in a “free society.” Instead, I encountered some of the most rational, intelligent discussions I’ve ever seen online. The Chinese language is so poetic and intricate, at least that’s my impression from reading English translations. I was met with so much warmth, rationality, and calmness. 

I broke down in tears. I have never felt so safe in an Internet space before. Their musings about harmony and connection touched my heart as someone who lives in a nation of distrust and division. And I know it doesn’t show the whole China. There are probably bad parts I’m not seeing. I think there are things they could learn from us as well. I think a good nation needs to have a balance of individualistic and collectivistic qualities. Coming from the U.S., seeing a nation that is so united is beautiful. ",311,

"Similarities in ""fake"" content (between XHS and TT)","I feel like I'm probably a little late to realizing this, but today I had my first proof that, sometimes, the really beautiful people wearing the really nice clothes are not, in fact, doing the hard labor they are shown doing in a series of clips. Sometimes (especially the zoomed in bits) there are signs of the *actual* person doing the work.

I knew that this was common with TikTokers, YouTubers, etc. People building homes and so on are known for doing this. It's a good way to make sure you keep your limbs safe and someone gets paid for actually building your house and so on (though they don't get credit - kinda like a ghostwriter). Anyway, I guess I was a little disheartened to see it on XHS as well, even though, duh!, they're content creators too!

To clarify, a video showed up on my Home page of a made-up Chinese woman in very pretty clothes smashing and chopping really hard food ingredients outdoors. There was also some wood chopping. I noticed that in the videos where she is full visible, there's a lot of cutting, and she's also having a really hard time. But in the videos zoomed in, she's doing everything so well. And then I saw it... the hands on one of the clips were *completely* different. Her hands are very slender (a lot of lotion). These hands were rough, hardworking hands. What's funny is no one in the comments points this out (on TT and YouTube, you will find at least one comment pointing it out).

Anyway, I just thought it was an interesting similarity/differences between content creators and users of both apps.

I'm seeing a handful of posts here and there with ""IP Address: United States"" speaking in broken English that looks like it has been either translated or looks like it was written by a bot. These comments are almost all confirmation-bias and rage bait posts supporting the worst stereotypes some of the Chinese have against the US.

Like, the US is a dumpster fire right now, I am well aware that things are rapidly going to shit here... but these sound like propaganda points. And we both have our propaganda.

Maybe it is just me. I took a break for a bit. I' just worried that we won't be siloed, we might be overrun with bots. I mean, if they can do it on Reddit why can't they do it there?

I don't believe Rednote will ban us unless we're discussing anti-China topics. If they do ban us, they risk losing a potential user who could promote Chinese culture or travel.

Can someone tell me what am I missing?

In the video, I go over:

* How to download Baidu Maps (it’s not as scary as it sounds, promise).
* How to switch on street view and “walk” around.
* A couple of tips to make it easier to use if you don’t speak Chinese.

It’s a fun way to explore cities or even small towns in China without leaving your house. If you’re curious about what China really looks like today, this might be for you.

In a different example: what if I talked about the history of my home area which is a working class area and touch on a social housing project that was very important here ?

All in a neutral educational tone. 

In another case: I also have content that is quite light hearted about quirky aspects of my countries culture that foreigners seem to enjoy a lot. Would that be well received ? What should I watch out for ?

Getting banned from RedNote,"When they say they don't want political posts, they mean it. Even posting content like labor history will get you banned.

Black Panther Party content will get you banned. You want to make the argument for the conservative position? Also banned. If you think they want to promote socialism.... nope. They want to live in harmony with America and if you suggest there have been and continue to be problems with the United States they will ban you. If you promote left or right perspectives of history, they will ban you. No politics means NO POLITICS. It may seem odd to the Western mindset, but remember: the West values individualism, the East values social harmony and collectivism. It's their platform, their rules, and that's fine.

here's how to add captions on RedNote!! more relevant than ever before,"The whole TikTok ban situation is pretty crazy, and since many of us are switching to rednote, I've also been messing around with rednote lately and realized how much captions help. Most people scroll on silent like on TikTok, so I thought I'd make a quick guide on how to add CC to your videos.

As we speak, these are your best options (note that I made the steps with chatGPT so it's easier to follow):

1️⃣ **Use rednote's very own ""Subtitles"" feature**

* Upload or record your video.
* Tap **“More”** \> **“Subtitles”** to enable auto-generated captions.
* Edit them before posting (limited styling options).

2️⃣ **Add captions manually with the ""Text"" tool**

* Tap **“Text”** on the right side.
* Type your captions manually.
* Set the duration for each one.

3️⃣ **Use an online AI for captioning**

* Upload your video to a tool (for example, sendshort)
* Auto-generate captions in seconds.
* Customize fonts, colors, and animations.
* Export and upload to rednote.

  
rednote does have a basic subtitle feature, but it’s pretty limited. If you want clean captions, you’ll have to do it manually or use an external tool.

If you need a full step-by-step guide, I put together everything here:

"Before you Ask, No it's not Chinese Propaganda","Disclaimer: I'm a Chinese, living in the US. I've lived in both countries for more than 15 years each.

Rednote/xiaohongshu (xhs)/小红书 is an app that came out in 2013. It's built by a Chinese company, for the Chinese both in mainland China and living overseas. The app used to be in Chinese only, and it didn't support English localization until recently.

A very common question I see on reddit or tiktok is whether all these Chinese posts from xhs are propaganda or not. The short answer is no. However, the long answer is more nuanced.

Let's break it down.

1. The platform initially was built for oversea Chinese for shopping. That's it, its initial focus was not to be a huge social media platform. However, almost all apps in China wants to be a social media platform for some reason. So xhs also has these features. So from the beginning, the app is not built to spread communist propaganda.
2. About 80% of the users are female (I forget where I get this data from, so I could be wrong). Lots of them are living average lives. I've been a user for 5-6 years, and I've seen posts ranging from ""how to deal with disagreements between wife and inlaws"" to ""how to study abroad"" to ""look at this new <insert a luxury brand> bag that I bought"" to ""the best/worst Chinese restaurant in Seattle/SF/LA"". Of course, there are a bunch of brainrot contents as well, tho not as prevalent as other Chinese platforms. There are topics about anime, daily lives, college dorm drama, stupid people showing off, travel tips, travel vlogs, anything really. Depending on what you click on, you get served different contents.
3. Why do you only or mostly see positive things so far? It's the algorithm again. You don't know the language, so you probably don't know which posts are talking about bad things or the usual drama stuff. In my FYP, there are still many posts about users complaining about all aspects of their lives. The ML algorithm will group people by their characteristics. For example, you are joining from the US, and you clicked on some tiktok refugee posts, and the algorithm learns that. It will say that oh, you are probably interested in the topics that other people from the US like/read/watch.
4. There is another side to the ""only seeing positive things"". Chinese people are trying to be friendly and welcoming. It's Chinese tradition to not show the ugly business to the guests. So, in a way, that creates a skewed perception for the guests (you). However, you need to remember, there are 1.4 billions people there. They are individuals with their individual experiences. The idea you get from the aggregate is probably somewhere slight above average. This is due to the fact that people with worst than average lives are less likely to post. However, I don't think that constitutes propaganda. From a statistical standpoint, it's just the sample population doesn't match the distribution of the whole Chinese population.
5. There are Chinese people who like and hate China, just like any other country. However, I want to call out that because the US views China as its adversary, it puts a lot of effort in smearing China's image. This effort includes supporting the now outlawed religious group (Falun Gong, which is literally a cult if you look it up) and its media outlet Epoch Times, NTD and a bunch of YouTubers. Specifically, I want to call out ""China Insider"" ""China Observer"" and ""Serpentza"". These channels spew out misinformation like none other. The things they talk about doesn't reflect my personal experience at all. All this is to say, you will see Chinese/others who tell you this is all Chinese propaganda, and people who don't. Then how do you know who's right? I recommend traveling to China or talking to Chinese nationals around you to see what their perspectives are.
6. Last but not the least. The way the rednote gets popular is totally an unexpected event, both from the Chinese and American side. With the sudden influx of American users, I don't think anyone really had any idea how this was going to end. Since all the content on the platform are there for anyone to view, I don't think it's realistic to change what's being seen without its existing user base noticing.
7. (Forgot to add this point to my initial post). Remember how this platform was for Chinese only? Pretty much all the posts were in Chinese before the Americans joined. So it begs the question: how does xhs push propaganda to Americans and other non-Chinese-speaking foreigners when they can't even read what's there? Have you thought about that?

In conclusion, are the things you see on the platform real? Yes, most of them are real Chinese people posting real stuff, with some exceptions of ads and people heavily using filters (this is a huge thing on Chinese Internet, and we often joke about that). Are the cars and sky scrapers real and the scenery and the grocery hauls and house tours real? Yes they are, but also remember, there are 1.4 billion Chinese.

Annoyed at the Comment Deletions ,"Over half of my comments have been deleted. There is no rhyme or reason. It's really aggravating to put labor into something and it's just gone. Even back and forth discussions with Chinese Netizens zapped away. I really want to stay on Rednote, but it's discouraging that so many comments are deleted. Even in the middle of my reply, a Chinese Netizen comment will get deleted.",71,

"Maybe it's time to say it: ""XHS (RedNote) is not an accurate depiction of China/Chinese people. Its denizens never claimed it was.""","This app is ***NOT*** a replacement for our American apps. It was not made for us. So...

* No, you will not learn ""the truth"" about China and the Chinese from it, just as you will not learn the truth about American politics from Fox or CNN
* No, you will not beat the system into submission by purposefully posting things to get yourself banned (you may, however, get all of is kicked off the app, if enough of you wish that for us out of spite or childishness)
* No, the Chinese people on XHS are not deliberately lying to you about what their lives are like in China; judging ALL nearly 1.5 BILLION Chinese on just \~100 posts you've seen on XHS is like judging all Americans by watching how our celebrities behave
* Yes, some people are much, *much* better off than others in China; some have wonderful apartments in a city like Shanghai and some live in poverty in the derelict villages of a province like Guizhou
   * When in doubt about this... look to yourself: Can you not think of something comparable in the US? For example: those who live in New York City or San Francisco vs those who live in towns in Virginia? Which side do we show to the world in our most popular shows (i.e. *Friends*)?
* Yes, you can actually still learn quite a lot about Chinese culture from XHS, but understand that this is not an American app; it was not made for Americans living under the American Constitution

If none of this makes sense and you still want to pick little fights here and there... there is always X. There is always Meta. There is always whatever will become of TikTok.

And if you want a comprehensive information source of ALL \~1.4 billion Chinese citizens, an app is *definitely* not the place to find it. The same goes for apps like TikTok, where ""everyone"" can apparently post and ""be seen"". Do you think all Americans are represented on TikTok? (If so, we're in more trouble than we thought.)

So, for those of you who get what I'm saying (even from the title), this isn't a message for you. But for those who feel a strong desire to downvote this simply because it's rubbing you the wrong way or you have a different opinion... Please reflect and reconsider.",421,

How long does a shadow ban on red note last?,"To give context I have likely been shadow banned due to mass reporting because of one of my posts.

Explosive Growth on Red Note: Insights on Top Categories for Creators,"Red Note has been going through some dramatic changes recently with the influx of new users, especially international creators. As someone who has worked in content creation for years, I’ve been closely following these shifts and wanted to share some insights. Using data from third-party analytics sites and my own observations, I’ve analyzed the categories currently driving the fastest follower growth on the platform.

If you’re trying to grow on Red Note, here’s what’s trending right now:

# 1. Categories Driving Follower Growth

# Content Popular with International Users:

1. **Creators Who Speak Their Language**: International users naturally gravitate towards creators they can easily understand and relate to. Being able to communicate in English or another widely spoken language is a big advantage.
2. **Rural and Countryside Aesthetics**: Videos highlighting simple, idyllic countryside life or rustic home decor are resonating strongly. While not as polished as Li Ziqi’s productions, content with titles like “Rural Living” or “Cozy Home” is gaining significant traction.
3. **Travel and Tourism**: Unique destinations like Chongqing, with its cyberpunk aesthetic, remain a huge draw. Videos exploring cultural landmarks or visually stunning locations are performing exceptionally well.
4. **Comedy and Humor**: Quick, relatable, and funny videos that feel native to platforms like TikTok are thriving. English-speaking comedy creators who can capitalize on trends and deliver entertaining content are experiencing explosive growth.

# Content Popular with Chinese Users:

1. **Attractive Creators**: This evergreen category continues to dominate—everyone loves watching charismatic personalities.
2. **Foreign Talents Showcasing Skills**: Singing, crafting, makeup, or other artistic talents displayed by international creators are drawing a lot of attention. For many users, this content feels fresh and engaging.
3. **Lighthearted Humor and Memes**: Fun, easily digestible videos—whether about everyday life or playful cultural comparisons—are always a hit.
4. **Cross-Cultural Interactions**: Videos featuring cultural exchanges, such as foreigners trying Chinese crafts or reacting to local trends, spark curiosity and often go viral.

# 2. Algorithm Instability and Hashtag Saturation

Red Note’s algorithm is clearly under strain from the sudden surge in activity:

* **Feed Instability**: The homepage alternates unpredictably, sometimes showing mostly international content and other times almost nothing. This inconsistency is impacting visibility across the board.
* **Hashtag Overload**: Popular hashtags like “TikTok refugee” have become oversaturated with over a million posts. Using these tags now often dilutes your content’s reach rather than boosting it.

# 3. Avoid Ad Spending During Instability

If you’re considering running ads on Red Note, now might not be the best time. Both from personal experience and third-party data, ad budgets are being consumed rapidly with poor returns. The current instability means you’re likely paying for impressions without meaningful engagement, so it’s better to focus on organic growth for the time being.

# 4. Long-Term Opportunities Amid the Chaos

While the current chaos is frustrating, it’s also creating opportunities for those who adapt quickly. Red Note is expanding its support for English-language users and encouraging creators to treat the platform as a **search engine** for valuable content.

Creators who can provide high-quality, culturally relevant content are likely to benefit the most in the long run. Whether you’re a new user or a seasoned creator, now is the time to experiment with formats and find what resonates with this evolving audience.

# Final Thoughts

These observations are just the beginning—there’s a lot more to uncover about how Red Note is evolving and what it means for creators. If you’ve noticed interesting trends or have questions about how to grow on the platform, feel free to share in the comments. Let’s learn and navigate this exciting time together! ",608,

Real Chinese here and how we think about the situation,"Edit: Corrected some grammar thing. And this is not an ad for Rednote so feel free to skip things here or maybe the whole post. I'm not trying to draw any attention, just offering information and personal fact check no matter anyone choose to believe or not.

I don't post literally anything here just browsing until some unbelievably unreasonable conspiracies started to show up in Tiktok, Reddit or everywhere.

**What was Rednote in its existing years?**  
A social platform designed for personal interests, guidance. More contents for women(Make-ups, fashion, etc).

**Is there censorship on Rednote and how is it?**  
Which I suspect it to be the most concerning question for you guys of the US so here it is:

Yes, like censorship exists in other countries but in different aspects.  
For example,  
you can't heil Na\*i in German but you can in Ukraine,  
you can't hate Is\*l or fr\*e Pa\*e in US but you can in China,  
you can't hate g0v publicly in China but you can in US.

The world is generally a big toilet under regulations if I were to say. But you don't necessarily need to force yourself to look at all the sh\*t, which leads to the next question.

**What should I do in Rednote?**  
Forget about the nasty things that deprive your happiness, and start to find nerds/pros that have the same hobbies/experience/etc in doing things. Watch, join the group and have fun, maybe share a little, which goes to the next question.

**How should I get my fancy fyp on Rednote?**  
Things you don't like, you don't press the like button,  
Things you like, you press the like button.  
Rednote does not push contents they think you like to your fyp(or just seldomly),  
you build your own fyp by actively liking and unliking the contents it randomly gives you.  
You will have your fancy fyp in 3 days in this way.  
And you can teach Rednote your lessons by actively searching the #hashtags you want.

**What should I do? it's all Chinese!**  
Yeah you guys just hate learning a new language. But for building your own fyp...  
Learn some Chinese nouns used in #hashtags. It will definitely worth your while.  
Ofc Rednote gave you the ""Translate"" button for the comments in less than a week with tons of hard work done by those bald devs, didn't they?

**Should I stay on Rednote?**  
For peaceful civilian users?  
Sure and welcome. It's up to you. And if safety concerns much, you don't ever get Rednote. We ain't forcing anyone doing anything. This app has been there for years, too many users walk-in and walk-out or never walked in.

For military guys?  
No, now GET your asses OFF this app before your FBI guys get you, before we Chinese ""spies"", for your own sake. But anyway we welcome the military guys share their national insecurity with us.

For anti-China guys?  
Your data collected both by China and CIA, with your account banned haha. We just laugh our asses off for you wasting your time doing it then get AI algorithm spending electricity banning you. And you better hope you don't get into trouble with your CIA agents.

**Conspiracy how Rednote relates to Tiktok ban?**  
This was not a question for me until I saw whole lot of conspiracies about this everywhere when I woke up in the morning from my bed in China with my messy hair.

Guys, can we please, you have been too politicized for decades that can we stop politicizing everything?  
Tiktok was to be banned, you guys walked into Rednote unforced, we welcomed you, you had fun and talks on Rednote.  
And Tiktok unbanned...  
Now some nerds start to drag your type of conspiracy into Rednote? Really?

Oh OK, you want to politicize this? Then we poIiticize this.  
I can't represent everyone here in China, but a lot of us have this kind of opinion:

It was the mass move from Tiktok to Rednote, made US g0v unban Tiktok,  
because banning Tiktok, randomly forced you to see how true Chinese live their meal-to-meal lives, which turned out to be better than the working class in US in many aspects,  
which is the fact US g0v is afraid of you to discover.

Oh another thing, El\*n's mom has been living in Shanghai China for more than 1 year, and she has been actively using Rednote until you guys came in then slapped her.  
What kind of nation would the leader of your DOGE apartment send his mom to and let her live in for more than a year?

A more politicized edit for this section:   
For people who shares skills/hobbies/daily/advice/etc, they are well welcomed on Rednote even now.   
For people who see the problem during this cyber journey, we really want them to go back and make US better so US still holds as the lighthouse of this planet in a good way. MAGA in a more correct direction if I were to say.  
  
But for those who stubbornly think we censor this censor that, communism, dictating, US No.1, forced labor, child labor, blah blah...   
A lot of us unconditionally agree with these stubborn ideas and will do whatever we can to help these people sink in their ideas so they don't discover the fact in a easier way now but in a rude way maybe 10 years later. They keep using their stubborn & ignorant head to slow down, or should we say, demolish US yet they don't know they are doing so. And unfortunately, they are the majority of US. Claps.

Why Is Rednote Safer Than U.S. Apps When It Comes to Privacy?,">Conclusion:[​](https://rednotewiki.org/blog/how-safe-is-rednote-for-your-privacy/#conclusion)

>Red > WhatsApp > X Corp in terms of data privacy and safety.  


>Rednote (Xiaohongshu) appears to be the safest:

>\- Tracks the least amount of cross-app data (only identifiers).

>\- Provides the most categories under Data Not Linked to You, reducing the association between collected data and your identity.

>\- Although data is linked, fewer categories are tied to your identity compared to X or WhatsApp.

The result shocks me. I really believed that at least WhatsApp should be privacy safer!

Thawing Cold Wars with Cultural Exchange,"The TikTok/RedNote cultural exchange is giving me flashbacks to the Cold War in the 1980s when I was part of bringing Americans to the USSR for in-home visits with Soviets. Then as now, there were a lot of built-up misconceptions about the other side, and it was always wonderful to see the heartfelt connections being made when people recognized their shared humanity.  Many friendship started on those trips that are still thriving today!
  
I guess I'd thought we don't need explicit cultural exchange anymore, because it's so much easier with the Internet to reach out and connect with people from other cultures. Back then, we had to get on a plane and fly half across the world, but now everyone is just a few clicks away! And yet so many of us just don't think to do it.   

So, I'm cheering you on for taking this leap! You've stepped outside our usual bubble and opened up to the wonderful people ""over there"". I hope the seeds planted now grow into beautiful friendships for years to come.

I know you're all doing it for a variety of reasons, but through your actions, you're doing your part to help thaw US/Chinese relations. We all share this one planet… we'll be happier if we all get along!",220,

Looking for suggestions,"Hello rednote pros!

I'm a rednote newbie, who discovered it this week along with the current wave of new US arrivals lol

I was not a tiktok user but I was loving rednote. It was refreshing to find a space where I could actually find artists' content and not have to dig thru the clutter of influencers and ads and unrelated content in tags. 

In the last 24 hours the algorithm has taken a hard nose dive and all the artists' posts are gone and all i'm finding is Americans posting nonsense. it seems to have happened after the ""translate"" feature was implemented.

Does rednote suggest posts by location? like am i getting all of these suggested posts because of ip addresses? is there a good way to train my algorithm to not do that? 

 I find it super frustrating to not only have had Chinese artists' content displaced in their own app but I have no interest in the American suggested posts.... Any advice/suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

**\*\*About income\*\***

Every country has a poor population, but how do governments solve it? There is a saying in China that goes, '授人以鱼不如授人以渔', it means that teaching people how to fish is better than giving them fish. In China, if you are a homeless person, you can learn various skills needed to find a job for free in the community, and the community's rescue station will provide you with free accommodation and foods until you find a job and return to a normal life. For remote villages, the government will build roads into the mountains (you can see China's infrastructure level on any website), provide you with access to water and electricity, and teach you various methods of making money that are suitable for the local area. Through various policies and actions, China has lifted the vast majority of people out of poverty (see World Bank: Lifting 800 Million People Out of Poverty – New Report Looks at Lessons from China's Experience). It can be said that in China, as long as you are not lazy, you can live like a person. People will not discriminate against you, but rather praise your diligence.



And some people ignore the actual situation when discussing this issue. For example, I saw in a post (citing the original text): '...even China's former Premier Li Keqiang said that 600 million people in China earn less than 1000 yuan per month, and showing these poor lives to the public is not allowed in China because it will deepen people's doubts about the effectiveness of the Communist Party's economic policies.'

This statement is contradictory in itself. If 'showing poor lives to public' leads to 'people's doubts about the effectiveness of the Communist Party's economic policies', if the Communist Party is afraid of people knowing this, then how did the poster hear Premier Li Keqiang's speech on income?

The fact is that there are approximately 300 million minors (under the age of 18) in China. In China, even if you have no money, you still have the opportunity to finish high school, so most young people will choose to study instead of work, unless your studies are very poor. At the same time, China provides financial assistance for impoverished individuals, allowing those from financially disadvantaged families with excellent academic performance to pursue further studies in universities without worrying about financial issues. Due to various reasons, this group of people indeed have an income of less than 1000 yuan, but education will enable them to have a better life in the future. At the same time, there are about 270 million elderly people in China, a large part of whom rely solely on pensions for their livelihoods, which is a normal phenomenon in any country. We haven't included those who have just been lifted out of poverty here.

So, the so-called '600 million people in China earlier less than 1000 yuan' is not a very serious issue in China. Solving it is the goal of China's development, but not a serious problem. And China's low prices have once again eroded its severity. In remote areas, prices are even lower than what you see on Red Note.





**\*\*About Content Censorship\*\***

Firstly of all, there are not many topics related to politics or current events in Red Note, as there are not only Red Note in China. We have our own social platforms where we can discuss politics or current events, such as Bilibili or Weibo. And Red Note itself is a social platform for sharing daily life, I don't understand why the lack of political content on Red Note has become its disadvantages. It's as ridiculous as complaining that McDonald's doesn't sell guns.



Secondly, each country and social platform has its own content censorship and there is content that cannot be posted. Stirring national division is the most typical example, which is clearly not allowed in any country. In fact, all the 'non publishable content' we discuss is based on whether local laws and culture allow it. In the United States, where there is a 'Cancel culture', are you really not afraid of saying the wrong words when speaking on social media? And it reminds me of the incident where Trump was banned from Twitter. Of course, as a Chinese, I don't want to comment on whether Trump really instigated the incident.

What I want to say is that if western social platforms DO NOT restrict the release of content, why does the American people not know that China is not a terrible country until today and 2025? That the Chinese don't dislike all Americans. That they have low-cost food and medical care, advanced mobile phones and cars, blue sky and white clouds, etc.. Why are these things not known until 2025, when American peoples enter Chinese social media platforms?

That's right, Western people are the ones who suffer the most from content censorship.



Finally, China's censorship system is not as strict as some people claim, provided that what you are saying the truth. Let's take poverty in China as an example. If you go to poverty-stricken areas to film how poor the living standards of the locals are, and explain clearly what causes poverty and changes in the living standards of the locals, then this video will not only not be banned, but will also gain a huge number of views. But if you say that China's economic policies are flawed just because there are '600 million people in China earlier less than 1000 yuan', then it is one-sided. I have already explained earlier that this is just a problem that appears large in numbers but is not serious. Please remember that poverty alleviation is not about suddenly increasing your income from 1,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan, it is a long process, but some people overlooked it.

Furthermore, it should be noted that true censorship is conducted by social platforms, not by the government. Unless the content you posted seriously endangers social security, the government will not take direct action. Because they have more important things to do, such as how to make the Chinese people live better. For the platform, the purpose of strict review is to get rid of responsibility. For example, if a group of people discuss inciting riots on a certain platform and are not banned, the platform will also bear corresponding punishment when the riots actually occur. I believe this is easy to understand.





**\*\*About collect personal information\*\***

The personal information we are discussing here mainly refers to information about daily life, such as what I did today or what I discussed with friends. The attention to collecting personal information is directly related to content censorship. So this part can also be considered as a supplement to the above.



Generally speaking, a person who publishes wrong content on the Chinese Internet will not have any consequences. At most, the relevant content will be deleted. The 'wrong content' referred to here includes but is not limited to making or disseminating false information, fraudulent information, selling illegal products, slandering the government without factual basis, and so on. But if this person repeatedly posts incorrect content, their account may be banned by the platform. Only when the content posted causes certain social harm, such as promoting violence or causing economic losses to many people, will the Chinese government take corresponding measures against this person, because such behavior is already illegal.



This is the situation in China, and then let's talk about the United States. To say the least, even if the Chinese government really collects personal information of Americans as some people advocate, what will happen? Will the Chinese government care if you have breakfast? Care if you brag to your friends? 'Oh! Because I spoke bad words about China, the Chinese government wants to launch laser weapons from the moon to eliminate me!' Funny. In fact, the Chinese government cannot do anything to you because we respect the laws of the United States and it is legal to speak bad words about China in the United States. You won't be banned from traveling to China just because you say a bad words about China online.



So what if these information are obtained by American companies or the US government? Perhaps, just perhaps, they will not use this information out of noble moral sense. (However, it is still the same question. Why did the American people know today what kind of life the Chinese live?)

  


**\*\*About some Chinese people\*\***

The Chinese people haven't lived so well since decades ago, and we have also experienced quite a long period of pain after World War II. During this period, the rapid development of the Western world, represented by the United States, has indeed attracted the attention of the whole world. And some Chinese people chose to go to Western countries to live a better life, rather than stay in China to help their motherland develop. This is understandable, everyone has the freedom to pursue a better life.



After entering the 21st century, China's economy has begun to rise, and people's lives are improving every year. However, due to the lag of information, some Chinese still believe that the western world is paradise. Meanwhile, those who have already gone abroad still believe that China is still a backward country due to the information cocoon created by Western media. Therefore, in 2010, especially after 2020, there are not a few people who think that the life of the Chinese people is difficult.



For those who aspire to the Western world, they do not want to believe that China's quality of life has surpassed that of the West. Why? As I mentioned earlier, in China, as long as you are not lazy, you can become an normal person. In other words, if you are not living as well as others, the main reason is that you do not have their talents or you are not as diligent as others. Some people are unwilling to admit this, so they are more willing to believe that this is a social problem, a national problem.

Meanwhile, the Internet has expanded people's desire. This has led some people to have material pursuits beyond their abilities, wanting to become wealthy without labor. Interesting thing is, the US government reports that Chinese people are living a bad life every day, while the Chinese government rarely reports how bad Americans are living. Therefore, these people truly believe that they can live a happy life by doing any job in the United States.



On the other hand, for those Chinese who have already gone abroad, especially those who have only gone abroad in recent years, they have seen the shortcomings of the United States, but they cannot say. Admitting this means they makes a foolish decision. So some people may have a tendency to belittle China and praise the United States. You should know that the cost of settling in the United States is high. Especially the cost of settling in the United States is high.



In fact, since a few years ago, many people have compared the life of China and western countries and told the Chinese that 'we are not so bad'. These people are not only telling their own experiences, but also showing Chinese people photos and videos from abroad. But the two kinds of people I mentioned above have been strongly denying it for their own reasons. Until 2025, Americans personally compare the lives of the two peoples.



**\*\*Conclusion\*\***

Is China a perfect country? No. We are a developing country and we still have many social issues to address. The 'development' here does not mean which country is stronger economically, but how to make Chinese people live a better life.

Is the United States a backward country? Absolutely not. As the world's most powerful country, the United States still has a lot to learn from.

If you don't believe everything I say, I hope you can download Red Note and take a look. Or if possible, come to China for tourism in person.

China is not an evil country. The Chinese people are warm and friendly. Not only the United States, we welcome anyone friendly to visit China. Any nationality, any race, any belief, any gender... As long as you come with kindness, we will repay you with even greater kindness.

"Can't text the word""rednote""","My wife and I downloaded rednote as a alternative to tic tok before the ban. 

My wife sent me a text asking me for my rednote ID so we can send either other vids. However I never got the text message.... she sent it 2 more times...same thing.... She removed the word ""rednote"" from her text and the message came through no problem. 

She again sent the message with ""rednote"" in the text...never received it... Then I sent test messages for troubleshooting. Every message that involves rednote in the text never goes through....

"As an advertising company on Xiaohongshu, I would like to discuss how Chinese companies perceive Xiaohongshu","Due to the TikTok incident, many people have been discussing Xiaohongshu, and a lot of conversations are happening around the platform. As an advertising company that has been operating on Xiaohongshu for three years, I want to share how Chinese businesses view Xiaohongshu.

1. **Audience Characteristics on Xiaohongshu** Xiaohongshu is the second-largest social media platform in China, following Douyin, with 300 million monthly active users. One of its core competitive advantages is its young female demographic. Data indicates that 70% to 80% of Xiaohongshu's users are women, and a significant portion of them are aged between 18 and 35. This group is highly interested in fashion, beauty, and lifestyle.
2. **What Content is More Popular on Xiaohongshu?**

* **Excellent Visual Presentation** For example, beautiful food pictures that are vibrant in color and exquisitely plated, making them irresistible at first glance. Fashion outfit images show a variety of styles, instantly making one envision how they would look in those outfits.
* **Sharing Content About Improving Quality of Life** Such as creating a cozy home environment, preparing healthy breakfasts, learning new skills like painting or photography.
* **Social and Interpersonal Relationship Expansion** Xiaohongshu’s social attributes offer users a new social platform. TikTok users have been warmly welcomed on Xiaohongshu due to this background. For example, we’ve produced content where travel enthusiasts shared their travel experiences on Xiaohongshu and found like-minded partners to plan their next trip together. Moreover, user interactions and exchanges aren't limited to the online space; sometimes, they extend offline, forming real-life social relationships.
* **Self-Growth and Knowledge Acquisition** Xiaohongshu is not just an entertainment platform; it also contains a wealth of knowledge content. Whether it's career experience sharing, learning methods, or cultural knowledge dissemination, you can find it here. For example, some university students search for shared experiences on studying abroad, certifications, or internships to plan their academic and career futures.

**Xiaohongshu's Advertising and Marketing as a Key Business Model**  
Xiaohongshu's advertising marketing is one of its key business models. Many brands are eager to showcase their products on this platform because Xiaohongshu has a large and precise user base.  
According to statistics, the majority of Xiaohongshu’s monthly active users are young, fashionable, and have strong purchasing power.

  
Brands collaborate with influencers and celebrities on Xiaohongshu, who create beautiful posts to recommend products.  
For example, a well-known cosmetics brand partners with a beauty influencer, who shares her real experience using the product, including its texture, effects, and suitability for different skin types, along with stunning makeup photos or videos. This approach not only attracts followers' attention and purchasing desire but also boosts brand exposure and product sales, while the influencer gains commercial benefits, and Xiaohongshu collects advertising fees.

Edit: I've fixed my problem, but to do the self service release it asks for an Id number, what id is it looking for? I've seen people say passport ID number but my passport is expired",89,
Rednote sliently banned all my replies ,"Yes, I found that none of my replies received any likes or responses. I started to suspect there might be an issue with my account, so I used my friend's phone to check the same post and realized that my replies were indeed invisible. Here's what happened: recently, many Americans have started joining Xiaohongshu. Normally, I only browse posts without replying, but I wanted to show friendliness to these foreign users and also had some questions to ask, so I began replying to some posts.

I posted some photos of my pets to say hello, welcomed people who were hesitant about joining Xiaohongshu, and corrected some misconceptions about China that I thought were overly praised but still had underlying issues, like wages and living costs. I also asked questions about freedom of speech and workplace challenges in the U.S.

Then I noticed that, despite waiting excitedly for several days, none of my replies received any likes or responses. I realized that my account had been shadow-banned—I could see all my replies, but they were invisible to others when viewed from my friend's phone. To confirm, I used my friend's phone to post two replies: one was a simple greeting, and the other was a question I had wanted to ask. When I checked using my own phone, only the greeting was visible.

I have to say, I wasn’t entirely surprised because this is a common issue on Chinese networks. Every comment/post you make is subject to strict moderation, and you never know which statement might violate the rules. I was already being very cautious and avoided discussing any political topics, yet I was still unlucky enough to get shadow-banned.

"Y'all know why Trump suddenly became ""pro-TikTok"" right?","Say it with me: Because he and his oligarch buddies are getting worried Americans are waking up to the truth about all the anti-China propaganda BS they were fed by the US Gov't and media through simple exposure in Red Note and may either start demanding better conditions or go full socialist. 😄

ADDENDUM: We all know Trump is ""transactional"" and uber corrupt. That's the throughline we've all been fed. 

But I think it's simpler than that. 

Trump is a fake populist. His loyalties remain with his billionaire oligarch class interests. I mean he still has a business to run and he's a hardcore capitalist. The idea that the TikTok ban is pushing Americans deeper into the arms of the CCP must horrify him at an existential level.",136,

What You Need to Know Before Creating Content on rednote ,"“Chinese communities and platforms like Xiaohongshu are subject to front-end content moderation.
Before you post anything, it is reviewed to ensure it meets the platform’s standards.
This doesn’t mean control, but rather the maintenance of harmony within the community.
The platform conducts reviews of content to preserve a harmonious atmosphere, not just for the sake of control. Topics and content that align with the platform’s creative direction will receive additional traffic support. Applications like Xiaohongshu, which are centered around recommendation algorithms, have professional staff responsible for selecting and allocating topics, and content that fits the platform’s style will be rewarded with extra traffic.
What needs to be emphasized here is that you need to post content on Xiaohongshu that is related to life, interests, and needs, and is positive in nature. Content that incites oppositional emotions or excessively complains about any government is not allowed.
What you need is genuine life sharing, which is considered safe and highly inclusive of cultural differences. Milan Kundera’s concept of “living elsewhere” and people’s interest in the lives of others are innate human traits that cannot be separated. The recommendation algorithm used by Xiaohongshu is also widely used by many Chinese internet companies, providing users with a continuous stream of positive feedback.
Compared to TikTok, views on Xiaohongshu do not generate income.
On the Xiaohongshu platform, creators’ income mainly comes from brand collaborations and product promotions, rather than directly from platform traffic monetization. Xiaohongshu’s content ecosystem focuses on sharing real user experiences, making the platform more like a lifestyle community rather than a short video traffic monetization platform.
Compared to Instagram and YouTube, it is easier for ordinary people to be seen by other ordinary people.
Compared to Instagram and YouTube’s reliance on social graphs (relationship chains) in their recommendation algorithms, Chinese platforms in recent years have placed more emphasis on a highly agile distribution mechanism based on real-time indicators, aiming to solve the problem of ordinary content being discovered even in weak or zero-relationship states.
If you want to create, here’s what you should understand:
Mass contact between ordinary people in China and the United States is an unprecedented high-cost group phenomenon. The high cost referred to here is primarily economic. Travel expenses are substantial, and often only provide a superficial experience, as it’s not possible to casually stop and chat with foreigners on the street for hours. Secondly, there are operational costs; although the internet technically provides the possibility of connection, due to well-known obstacles, residents of different countries - excluding Chinese students studying in the U.S. or American managers working in China - find it difficult to be in the same communication space. Lastly, there are opportunity costs, that is, why people gather and communicate. In the past, such communication opportunities were accidental, such as when a game facing the global market was live-streamed in China for a preview, attracting foreign players to watch.


I am an entrepreneur in China and also operate my own Xiaohongshu account. If you are interested in the topic of operating Xiaohongshu, please leave a comment below. I will reply in a timely manner and provide a detailed introduction to some related rules, covering topic selection, image titling, and more. I hope to provide some help to foreign friends who plan to join Xiaohongshu.

If you find the expression inaccurate, it's likely my shortcoming. This post was first written in Chinese and subsequently translated with the assistance of a large model. Given my limited English proficiency, crafting large paragraphs of fluent English proves challenging. Your understanding would be highly appreciated.

Dear friends,  
I have noticed that some scammers have targeted Xiaohongshu (RedNote). They are using online cross-border transactions or transfers to conduct fraud. The users of Xiaohongshu are kind-hearted and will never ask you for money online, so please remain vigilant.

Please do not trust financial information online and avoid transferring money to strangers. If you are being scammed while shopping internationally, promptly file a complaint against the seller on the relevant shopping platform. If you paid via Alipay, PayPal, or other online payment platforms, contact their customer service immediately to freeze the transaction, and do not let the scammer easily withdraw funds from the payment system.

Finally, please make sure to file a complaint and request to freeze the transaction until the seller can provide proof of genuine shipment information.

I wish that all transactions around the world proceed safely and smoothly.

"If you think China is great after browsing posts on Xiaohongshu, please read this post. ","Americans hear people on Xiaohongshu saying they envy China's lack of property tax on homes, but they don't know about the countless unfinished housing projects here. They convert Chinese prices into dollars and think everything is dirt cheap, but we don't earn in dollars. Labor services are cheap because we have a large population and no unions, which makes individual labor undervalued and exploitable. They admire the low cost of healthcare here, but soon, apart from officials, no one will be able to access effective imported original drugs.

Both sides have their pros and cons, and plenty of things that make you want to curse. But when Americans hear the survivor bias of Xiaohongshu users who live middle-class lifestyles and imagine this place as a utopia, it’s so naive it makes me laugh. From an American's perspective, everything in China does seem great—because you're an American.

Discussion: Xiaohongshu (RedNote) is not a theme park,"**TL;DR: Please, let's not treat XHS and Chinese people like an attraction. If we plan to stay on XHS, let's work just as hard and earn our follows through work that reflects the kind of work the app is known for.**

I saw a video earlier today from a young Chinese woman criticizing ""Tik Tok refugees"" for continuing, even after a few days, to exclusively call XHS denizens and Chinese people ""sweet"" and ""nice"". She wanted to remind us that they are more than that, especially the young women of XHS. That they are ""badass"". That they work really hard to make XHS what it is, what we found when we walked in, and that just calling Chinese people those two words diminishes all the hard work they put, sometimes for hours, to make the great content they make. (And it's no surprise that there were others who agreed with her as the hours went by.)

Let's face it. A lot of ""Tik Tok refugees"" waltzed into RedNote and got an instant flood of Likes just for showing their Western face (and their cats). But if you dig deeper - as I'm sure many of you already have - you will find so many wonderful Chinese creators doing some really incredible sh\*t which they've clearly spent many hours on... and they have like 200 Likes.

Anyone who has been on Tik Tok long enough remembers the old joke: Some random dude shows some insane art piece he spent 30 hours on and he gets 450 Likes. Some random woman shows up in a bikini, does a twirl to 9 seconds of a song, and gets 450k Likes. (for the sake of this discussion, let's ignore that this is America: sex sells and art only sells when money is being laundered)

THIS WEEK, and probably only for this week, ***we*** ""Tik Tok refugees"" are the random chick doing the twirl. 

But I hope that we can be more than that, and that we can begin to see the wonderful people we're interacting with as more than just ""sweet"" and ""nice"". Because XHS is not a dancing app; it isn't another Tik Tok. It's its own thing. And the best way we can respect what its denizens have made of it, is for those of us who plan to stay, especially those who create similar content, to work just as hard. 

We may be guests here today, but those who end up staying (esp. if nothing changes and we're not given a separate American app) will also become denizens of XHS (maybe more like... immigrants), and be just as responsible for the high quality of work which has made it what it is. This may, hopefully, include learning to mindfully create content in Chinese (think about it; Chinese who make content for IG make it in English, so why don't we try to do the same?).

Every day, Americans walk into DisneyLand, talk about how nice it is, take photos and videos, and leave everything a mess for someone else to clean up when they're done with the attractions. I hope that we will not share that side of our culture with 小紅書.

How to use audios?,"My vision’s pretty bad, so joining a platform with a new interface is already a hassle because there’s no muscle memory. Since it’s in another language I’m pretty much screwed. Im trying to make my usual content that I posted on TikTok but one of my last hurdles is figuring out how to use audios correctly, since you can’t just click on the icon in the corner like with TikTok. I’ve only found one video that let me save the audio. Even videos that should logically have save-able audios actually don’t. Can someone tell me how to navigate this so I can post content? I don’t speak in videos and I’m worried this is the end of my content creating career. Please help",127,

censorship policy on rednote,"I am a long time red note user, use to work in Chinese press media and my partner use to work in moderation team for large internet companies in China. here is just my own opinion to help you understand how moderation system works. and why posts are removed or banned.

READ the COMMUNITY POLICY first. its short and sweet.

1. Red note moderation is on strict side of social media in China and use mostly human to moderate (AI may use for easy cases and not as good as other companies).  Human makes mistake and AI auto moderation is not as good as big companies, so sometime just submit the content again or a few times and it will pass the moderation.

2. Also they dont have enough English moderators hence causing delay. I believe this will be fixed soon as they are rapidly recruiting.

3. One important difference between Chinese moderation and US is there is an Chinese policy for media platforms to bring unity and avoid division between people, commonly demonstrated by mass involved hostile arguement and personal attackes. If people start to fiercely argue in your post and attacking each other, it will get quickly taken down, regardless of the content.


4. Also a post with foreseable baiting for confrontation will easily be banned. This policy sometime partially also manifest as you can discuss your small group interest but not promote it (LGBT, Religion). Also kindly note its against national policy to associate any demographic/political groups to negative actions(or even positive sometime to insert sueprimacy). easy way to avoid this is to talk about the action, and yourself. dont lable people and dont represent.

approved examples:

a. here is a person/ visitor shoplifting, all our shops are closed, what can I do?

b. my hometown is ruined, I am so sad.

c. I am LGBT so tramatized by my school bullies.

d. I am a Christian, here is my routine

problematic examples:

a. A indian/muslin/black is shoplifting, all our shops are closed

b. my hometown is ruined by immigrants, I am so sad.

d. I am so tramatized by the white/asian/black/LGBT bullies

c. Christians are the kindest people, here is how we unit.

4. There are certain things not allowed in China but allowed in US, such as fire arm testing and cutting down tree. if its harmless, you can just put text in the discription saying that 'its taken overseas and following local regulation with no malicous intent.' it will help the content passing moderation.

5. sex, gambling, drugs, violence is an absolutely nooooo.

____ above are general national level policies, Red note specific features are below____

1. red note is for life style, political contents has very low tolerance.

2. the content should not make other people uncomfortable(per community rule). Remember its for mostly women (at some point 80% female users). so contents talored for man's attention (such as alluring female performance) is very likely to be reported compare to showing off big sis's body build.

3. Also things like snakes and insects may be flagged (fo possiblely uncomfortable) and only promoted to people with the interest but not general public (the platform welcome professional creater so it will likely to lift it if you are have high quality content)

4. click baiting has less tolerance (per community rule)

5. excessive showing off wealth has less tolerance (per community rule)

6. sponsored video need to ne labelled

7. insults and comments making others uncomfortable can easily be reported and taken down, especially causing hostile arguements. (but remember, people have different views... so your post may be offencive without even knowning it)

8. .... and some other rules I can't remember..... 

if you are banned for security risk, its not about the content. its about been lable a bot or account issue. did you just register and did not partcipate in the community before posting? did you connect your phone number? did you repost viral video feom Tiktoc(which may have been spamming red note before) ? 

please make sure your participate in the community and nurture your account before frequent posting.


____

Basically, sharing things about yourself, your experience, your life, giving advise, be supportive, be possitive, you will be alright.

Everyone on rednote have had encountered moderation issues sometime. dont take it personally. sometime resubmission will make it work. and they will improve fast :)

On the other hand, this is what makes red note a warm and welcoming community.

Hope you enjoy the red note :)

,"In China, religious topics can be discussed, but the following points should be noted:

**Legal framework**: China's Constitution guarantees freedom of religious belief, but religious activities must be carried out within the law and must not violate social order or harm the rights and interests of others.

**Religious policy**: The government manages religious affairs according to law, adheres to the principle of separating religion from politics and education, and prevents religious interference in administration, justice and education.

**Social harmony**: Religion should be discussed with respect for different beliefs to avoid sparking conflict or undermining national unity.

**Cultural background**: China is a multi-religious country, with Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Christianity, etc., and the history and culture of each religion should be respected during discussion.

**Online speech**: When discussing religion on the Internet, it is necessary to abide by relevant laws and regulations to avoid spreading extreme or illegal content.

All in all, religion should be discussed with respect for the law, culture and social harmony to avoid controversy.

This is the answer provided by the AI, and I think it is generally accurate. Additionally, I would like to mention that the majority of Chinese people are atheists, although some still worship ancestors or deities, including myself. Perhaps this behavior can be summarized as a traditional custom.

This is a very interesting post and I like the points you pose. I can share experience and thoughts on a few of these from the mostly typical American perspectives.  Mileage may vary.

Metropolitan areas like Portland and Salt Lake City tend to have more college-educated individuals due to diverse professors and coursework. Higher education broadens perspectives, while rural areas often prioritize trades, agriculture, and family life.




In places like Ohio, the lower cost of living and fewer high-paying job opportunities reduce the emphasis on higher education. Life revolves around tight-knit communities—family, friends, and neighbors—rather than meeting people from across the world. The focus is on maintaining strong local connections, not expanding global perspectives.




Reddit has its fair share of contrarians who love to argue but hate being challenged, creating endless echo chambers. Political divides have made this worse, and while Facebook has similar issues, 4chan is the bottom of the barrel, fostering extremists and incels who blame women for their loneliness. That said, Reddit isn’t all bad. There are still great subs like RedNote, animal rights activism, photography circles, and small animal care communities that make it worth staying.




Extreme wealth is shoved in our faces daily, while the lower middle class is ignored. Wealth equals morality, which is completely backward. One of the worst offenders? “Tradwife” influencers—privileged housewives in designer clothes, whipping up homemade gummy bears in spotless kitchens (definitely maintained by a maid) while preaching submission to husbands. These women ooze privilege, dragging their unschooled kids on voluntourism trips just to exploit village children for Instagram Likes. It’s as fake as those staged animal rescue videos where they “save” the creature they just put in danger.




As a stay-at-home mom, my reality is vastly different. Most of us don’t have the financial luxury to stay home, and for autistic parents with autistic kids like me, keeping a job is even harder. That means getting creative with expenses. At least Reddit has decent moderators who delete the worst content, and I’m grateful for platforms where activism can still be shared—especially since access to real resistance news is becoming harder to find.",353,3.0

,"Thank you for sharing your perspective on rednote aka xiaohongshu. Based on my observations over the past while, i’ve found that rednote is generally a calm, positive, and supportive social platform. of course, like any social platform, there are also unfriendly or ""bad” people, but that’s something you’ll find on every social media platform.

From what I’ve seen, rednote user base seems incredibly diverse. It has white-collar professionals and wealthy individuals from magecities like shanghai/beijing/shezhen, working-class folks and everyday people from smaller 2 or 3 tier citys, and farmers and herders from rural areas, as well as a ton of artists, craftsmen, and many china minority content creators. This diversity has been really surprising to me. After tiktok ban, there're also a lot of users from the US, Europe, and Africa, which makes it like a global village.

I’ve also noticed that many rednoters mention the search function in there. many brag it is excellent—in some ways, after i tried, i feel it even better than google or bing, especially for solving everyday life problems or giving travel tips. AIA rednote is full of practical, experience-based answers that feel very human and relatable. Speaking of Google, I’d like to clarify that google isn’t blocked/banned in china. From what I understand, google chose not to store its data in China, which is required by Chinese law, so its services aren’t available there. However, google’s commercial advertise services are remained and very profitable in China. so, it’s not accurate to say that “google is blocked or banned by china.” as far as i know, bill gate’s Bing and apple iCloud operate just fine in china.

As for how rednote users view other social platforms, I cannot speak for them but from what i observed, i'd say they’re pretty neutral overall, actually you can find lot of  posts discussing these topics; as long as it serves a specific need or purpose, chinese users will use it. reddit, for instance, doesn’t have many users in China, which might be good since reddit’s content, especially when it comes to chinese people and politics, often carries the typical Western biases and political correctness. but honestly, that’s not a huge deal—who can claim to be completely fair and impartial? Time will tell the full story.

At the end of the day, rednote can be seen as a small window into knowing china and its culture etc, as well as a place to discover interesting contents from all over the world. From that perspective, rednote is a great choice.",421,1.0

I enjoy cooking, and there are a few people I follow to learn how to cook Asian dishes (though my partner and ex are both Korean).

Mostly I'd like to better understand Chinese lifestyle from someone living there as such there are several (what seems to me as down to Earth) Chinese and non-Chinese who are American or other nationalities I like to follow.

I guess the Western media has ingrained how bad China is, so we all go in with preconceived notions and are always skeptical. But so far, everything feels authentic, but you take it all with a grain of sand.

Several mentions of toxicity - I guess I haven't found those yet - but if ""flexing"" is considered toxic, then yeah, I've seen quite a bit of that. But other than that, I haven't run into anything truly toxic.

,"Tier-1 cities: Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen

Tier-2 cities: Chengdu, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Tianjin, Wuhan, etc. (\~15 cities in total)

Basically tier-1 cities have a strong international element (more foreign companies, more foreigners living there), have better education and public health, and the cost of living there is much worse. In the U.S. tier-1 cities would be NYC, LA, Chicago, San Francisco and DC; and “strong tier-2” cities would be Boston, Seattle, Philly, Houston, Dallas and Miami.

RedNote users are mostly young white-collar workers in tier-1 and tier-2 cities, and ~~screw~~ skew female. This means that their purchasing power (real or fake) is much higher than other Chinese people, their social views are generally more liberal/progressive, and their lifestyle is generally more bourgeois. So most rural people, and even people in small cities, as well as the elders, are marginalized there (which tbf is the case for Chinese social media, or perhaps social media anywhere, in general) — although you can see some posts on RedNote about rural life if you intentionally search for such contents.

,"I think part of this is the app was downloaded and used so heavily by Americans who were so addicted to TikTok that they downloaded the first thing they were told was similar. These are not the most intellectually curious people - these are people who spend hours every day staring at a screen and moving a thumb. 

Also, these people seemed to be amazed at photos of buildings in China. These people could have googled this stuff at any point they wanted. They could have downloaded RedNote before TikTok shut down. They could have gone to their local library and checked out a book written by a Chinese author. They could have done *anything* if they were curious enough. They didn't want to. 

The 'Chinese people are so nice' thing. Have these people never met a person from China? Why are they so surprised? I went to university with scores of people from China. I had professors from China. I've worked with people from China. How is this their first time interacting with a person from China? That always made me quite sad for those people. I imagine they spend most of their time indoors looking at their phone. Why is this their first exposure to Chinese culture? It's bizarre to me. 

And don't even get me started with how the Americans on the app can't understand the difference between the words 'income' and 'net worth', lol. That actually says a lot about the type of people who use the app. 

Oh, and the people who say, 'my government told me that xxx is in China, but now I see it's not true on RedNote'. First - I don't think these people listen to anything but social media in the first place, so whatever perceptions they have of *anything* is probably shaped solely by social media. When I asked them for sources about how their government told them about China, they point me to Chinese state-run media, quotes from Chinese officials, or they can't remember where they heard it.

I mean, I've seen videos of the rich making a trip to Chanel and buying like 10k USD stuff at one go and be like, ""Oh this is nothing. I've spent so much and so much at \[Luxury Brand Store This and That\] before."".... I mean, I CAN NOT RELATE AT ALL. 

Also when I say toxic, I mean like.... sometimes when people perceived you said something wrong or they just didn't like your comment/opinion on Xiaohongshu, they dog pile you. Just like Reddit. 

My first week on Reddit, 2 different people made fun of me when I used ""oh"" in a sentence as a filler word because I didn't know what else to say. A couple more got really sarcastic and nasty when I asked about some English slang someone else commented because English is my 3rd language and I don't always get certain internet speak in English. I had to delete my comment because.... yeah, they were really getting to me.  

That said, you can curate what you see on Xiaohongshu a lot easier than other English platforms so not only is it possible to stay away from the toxic and just engage with the positive ones, it's also possible to make sure that it stays that way long term.

,"My perspective as an ABC who visited family in a bunch of parts of China recently!

\-There will be way more foreigners working and visiting in Tier 1 cities, but lots of Tier 2 cities also have many other foreigners at this point. The foreigners in Tier 2 cities (from my experience) will be fewer and generally English proficiency among locals will be somewhat worse though so plan accordingly with a translate app or something

\-If you're from the US, Tier 1 cities might feel more ""familiar"" with more chains, businesses you know, and attractions like Disneyland since lots of Chinese people themselves might travel to Tier 1 cities for an international experience

\-Rural parts lag behind in development but they're trying to improve! I'd really recommend you check out some rural parts because it's just so different and charming, like off the beaten path with locals who seem way friendlier and relaxed than the busy environment of the city. Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities just feel impersonal in my opinion, where everyone just rushes by. The rural towns don't feel like that and it's refreshing

\-Trying the food in rural areas is such a great experience. Lots of it is very directly farm-to-table stuff and it's handmade by traditional means so you aren't looking at some mass produced standardized recipe that's been served hundreds of times. Like most rural homestyle cooking, every dish is gonna be a bit different too so you're going to get something unique!

\-If visiting rural areas, just be mindful that they can be car dependent and public transit isn't going to be as developed so you might have to rely on a car or a taxi often

\-Rural towns like the one where my family originates have practically no English at all and usually no one is conversational in English",307,3.0
,"Tier-1 cities are much bigger, although even tier-2 cities are huge by American standard. Tier-1 cities have more ""conventional"" tourist attractions (think of Los Angeles vs Phoenix), and are generally more ""beginner-friendly"" regarding e.g., payment, hotels, and the language (more people in tier-1 cities speak reasonable English). If you have never been to China and your first experience is a tier-2 city, there might be some difficulties.

I'd say rural areas and small towns in China are also in decline, but the reason might be slightly different than the similar phenomenon in the U.S. The main reason is that most young people there have moved to bigger cities for better job opportunities, leaving the towns/villages half-empty with mostly elder people; in particular, there are fewer people actively farming the land. (I know this is also the case for some places in the U.S., but it happens much faster and on a much larger scale in China.) Another reason — which might be closer to why the Rust Belt is in decline in the U.S. — is that some towns boomed due to natural resources, and once the natural resources are exhausted or used less (due to e.g., switching to clean energy), the local economy just collapses. One extreme example is Old Town Yumen (玉门老城), which used to be an oil town but has been nearly completely abandoned after the government moved to the new downtown; you can see some [eerie videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe0ST-qNP64) online.",242,1.0

These people won't be using Rednote. Some say China's cities  so pretty. that's true. But the reason there are so many new buildings is because government officials and businesspeople can engage in corruption during infrastructure projects, and doing so without Chinese people's consent. Take a look at Chinese people's pensions and retirement funds - you guys don't know how lucky you are.",111,0.0

I tried posting something with that tag, and it said it was under review and would take 48 hours. I ended up editing the post to remove the tag, and it got approved immediately.",59,3.0

I believe if the people who downloaded XHS just used XHS as it was intended nothing bad would have happened but they flooded the system and treated it like a second Tiktok which it isn't. I also noticed that I'm seeing more Chinese creator content now which I am loving. I am still trying to learn the language so videos without subtitles of either Chinese or English are hard for me to follow but if I understand the context of the video I'll leave a like and comment.",120,3.0

,"I get the conclusion from being raised, living, and traveling in China. There are extremely small number of schools that have classes for people from Xinjiang. Most of the local residents in Beijing are not Manchu, I'm from there. And also Mancus is fully integrated into the Chinese society (they don't even have their language anymore), so does it really count?

Am I wrong about the issues minorities are facing in China? People are losing their languages. And issues are highly censored. Say Tibet for example, when people talk about the Dalai Lama, Chinese people talk about him like he's a devil, and fierce enemy of the Chinese government. But the thing is their relationship were not always this bad, and in 1979 there was even a delegation from the government in exile sent to China (and was welcomed very enthusiasticly). Discussions about having Dalai Lama return to Tibet was also active at that time, as he was important to the tibetans. Most Chinese kids have ZERO idea of any of this happened",173,1.0

,"You are right, poverty will always exist, but the problem in China is unfairness. Some people get a pension of 15 dollars a month, while others get a pension of thousands of dollars a month.
